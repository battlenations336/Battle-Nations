Captain Pike insists that they were on their way here to ask for our help. Apparently many lives are at stake, including our own.","mis_n01_intro_020_resources_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, is that it?

First, Floyd is a Civil Engineer, so that barely even counts. Second, we're helping you only because apparently our lives are at stake and I am a fan of living.

The Sovereign Navy has only recently come looking for us. As I suspected, they want this entire continent for their own purposes.","mis_n01_intro_030_defeatships_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wait, the whole continent? This one's claimed, pal. What's wrong with the one you came from?","mis_n01_intro_030_defeatships_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Ours is less than half the size. As you can probably imagine, we've run out of room and need to expand. The monarchy has chosen this land as their own.

The way you took out those ships was pretty impressive!","mis_n01_intro_030_defeatships_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Those poor bastards didn't stand a chance.

Why don't you take this drink I was going to give to Lt. Morgan. It's whiskey on ice though. I hope that's not a problem.","mis_n01_intro_030_defeatships_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I shall make due, but keep in mind that a true beverage aficionado needs nothing in his glass to lessen the true body and flavor of his spirits.","mis_n01_intro_030_defeatships_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Hey! That's my drink! What the hell, Perkins?!","mis_n01_natives_010_newworld_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Well Lieutenant, I think it's about time you Imperials were introduced to the larger world. You need to literally expand your horizons.","mis_n01_natives_010_newworld_10startdialog_0_body_1":"At the same time, I need to be getting back to the rest of my men with the supplies you put together for me. This is a perfect opportunity to do both.","mis_n01_natives_010_newworld_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh, you're finally leaving? That's too bad, really.

They don't look friendly either.","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Who the hell are those guys? And why do their ships look like cobbled together pleasure craft? Are we going water-skiing and pillaging?","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Ah, I figured this encounter was just a matter of time. We call them Reef Bandits and your Sergeant is correct about them not being friendly.","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Man your battlestations everyone! Things are about to get rough!","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_20hint_0_body_0":"Eventually you must face the monster you created.","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_60reward_0_body_0":"Water, water everywhere. Let's go have a drink.","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, that wasn't so bad? So, they're what, the Raiders of the sea or something?","mis_n01_natives_020_newkids_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Not quite. I'll explain in more detail later. Let's keep moving lest we get attacked again in open water.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright Pike, your colony is in sight. We should dock quickly before we get attacked again.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_10startdialog_1_body_0":"There should be plenty of space for your ships. Once docked, I'll have my men serve refreshments, and I'll shed some more light on our current situation.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_20hint_0_body_0":"I could use a quenching.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_60reward_0_body_0":"That's kind of sad. Well, let's go home now.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Now that everyone has been refreshed, let me introduce our translator Karin Winters. She's brilliant with language and she'll figure out that Reef Bandit jargon soon enough.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Thank you, Captain. I've been fascinated by language for as long as I can remember, but these Reef Bandits are tough to figure out. They're actually the main reason why Captain Pike and the rest of us decided to defect.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_70enddialog_1_body_1":"They used to inhabit the many smaller islands all through this area, but Sovereign actions forced them from their peaceful homes. They scavenge because they must to survive.","mis_n01_natives_030_pikeplace_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Do not mistake them as being simple or unsophisticated, it will be the last mistake you make. And know that they will attack you if they think you are Sovereign.","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So Pike, you say a huge fleet is moving toward the Outpost? How do we know if this information is accurate?","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That's why I came up here. I don't want to mobilize our fleets for nothing. We need some way of seeing things that are a great distance away. You Imperials have some impressive technology. Any thoughts?","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yes, actually! We call it RADAR and it essentially beams out pulses of radio waves which bounce off of objects then return to the radar station.","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_10startdialog_3_body_0":"We can get started on some radar dishes right away!","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_20hint_0_body_0":"Wait, do we need a self-destruct button for these?","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_60reward_0_body_0":"I know the perfect place to set these up.","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Fascinating designs Floyd. And you say this works over long ranges?","mis_n01_navalwar_010_lookahead_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, yes, within reason at least. As long as there's nothing large in the way, like say a mountain, the signal will travel for miles.","mis_n01_navalwar_020_animals_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Those islands there? The ones with the not-so-friendly-looking animals on them?","mis_n01_navalwar_020_animals_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yes Lieutenant, those islands are the perfect place to set up these radar stations. Unfortunately the \"local inhabitants\" are not very welcoming.","mis_n01_navalwar_020_animals_20hint_0_body_0":"I guess we could have another barbeque after this.","mis_n01_navalwar_020_animals_60reward_0_body_0":"Whoa there. Easy on the Floyd praise.","mis_n01_navalwar_020_animals_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Animal inhabitants removed and radar dishes set up and functional. We'll be able to see any potential enemies far before they see us.","mis_n01_navalwar_020_animals_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Excellent! You've once again proven your value, Floyd! What would we do without you?","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_10startdialog_0_body_1":"I tried to check on your radar set up when we got back but it's dead. No signal. Nothing.","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Hey Floyd! Get in here!","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That doesn't make any sense. I installed multiple backup power batteries. The only way they would cease to function is with tampering. We need to go see what happened to them.","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It's not going to be easy, I can tell you. My men noticed the signal had cut out as well so we stopped by to investigate on our way up here. Ships and mines are blocking each of the islands.","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_20hint_0_body_0":"Sounds like someone doesn't want us to see what's coming.","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_60reward_0_body_0":"Anyone else have an impending feeling of doom?","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_70enddialog_0_body_0":"That takes care of the blockade. And I think I can see why the radar isn't working. Someone broke it. Floyd?","mis_n01_navalwar_030_broken_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We'll need to return to the Outpost so I can gather materials. It looks like we should be able to salvage most of the current stations.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright folks. Let's get this agenda hashed out. We have two major issues at the moment. The first of which is getting those radar stations back online so we can see incoming threats.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm on it, LT! Floyd brought me up to speed on the innards of those contraptions. I got some repair kits ready to be built that'll fix 'em right up.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_10startdialog_2_body_0":"OK good. The future is looking less horrible already. What about the unsettling reports of submersible vehicles surfacing in the harbor? There've been no attacks but I want a way to track these things.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I have an idea for that. I modeled it based on the natural abilities of certain mammalian aquatic life. You see they send out high-pitched sound waves that they can\u2014","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Brilliant. Do it.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_20hint_0_body_0":"Um, alright then.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_60reward_0_body_0":"I think we'll stick with Sonar.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Radar Repair Kits are ready LT.","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_70enddialog_1_body_0":"What about you Floyd? We're all waiting on you now! Also, what do you call this thing?","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I've been calling it Sonar\u2014","mis_n01_navalwar_040_lightsound_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Seriously, that's just horrible. What about...Sound-Radar? Sound-Dar?","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Keep scanning, ensign. Those brigands are bound to be here somewhere. They were spotted surfacing only a few minutes ago. They can't have gotten far.","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Anything yet, Pike?","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Lieutenant! Nice of you to join us. Nothing yet, but we have narrowed down the search area\u2026","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_10startdialog_2_body_1":"There they are! Now quickly! To the ships before they can escape!","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_20hint_0_body_0":"I hope they like depth charges.","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_60reward_0_body_0":"After the defeat we just handed them, I doubt they'll want more.","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Those guys may have been there for a while. Who knows what kind of intel they were able to get from us.","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Anything they gathered is now resting at the bottom of the harbor. At least Floyd's \"Sonar\" should help us track any future incursions.","mis_n01_navalwar_050_search_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We should also begin regular patrols of our own subs in the area. I want to know  as soon as these guys come back.","mis_n01_navalwar_060_bigblip_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir? I've been tracking something odd showing up on radar. It looks like one of the islands is adrift and floating this way?","mis_n01_navalwar_060_bigblip_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Wait, wait, wait. I'm no\u2026 islandologist\u2026 but I don't think islands work like that.","mis_n01_navalwar_060_bigblip_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan is right, Perkins. That doesn't make any sense, but that is one huge blip. We should send out the fleet to find out whatever that thing is.","mis_n01_navalwar_060_bigblip_10startdialog_2_body_1":"I don't like this, Morgan. This doesn't feel right.","mis_n01_navalwar_060_bigblip_20hint_0_body_0":"What's the worst it could be?","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_10startdialog_0_body_0":"OK, so that's WAY worse than I thought it would be. How does that much metal not sink straight to the bottom of the ocean anyway?","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm not sure Lieutenant, but I think we should help it find its way down there.","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's the spirit, Sergeant! Pike? Got any ideas on how to defeat this thing?","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_10startdialog_3_body_0":"This is going to take every bit of sea-faring battle knowledge and cunning that I possess.","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_20hint_0_body_0":"So, easy win then?","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_60reward_0_body_0":"Wow. Facing down impossible odds should be a joyous occasion.","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I'd heard rumors of the Dreadnaught class ships while I was still in the service, but I never expected to actually see one. I think I need to go lie down.","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_70enddialog_1_body_0":"C'mon Pike! We did it! The immediate crisis and our imminent destruction have been postponed! Probably for a while!","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_70enddialog_1_body_1":"This calls for a drink!","mis_n01_navalwar_070_bigship_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I'm sorry Lieutenant, I just don't share your enthusiasm. The Sovereign Navy will be back. They won't take this well. I know. I used to be one of them.","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I need EVERYONE in here RIGHT NOW to address this serious problem! This affects us all!","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Emergency! Emergency!","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_1_body_0":"OK Morgan, we're all here! What's the terrible issue we must deal with?","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I thought I had a few more days left, but it finally happened. We need to send a fleet of ships down to Pike's Port City and ask for help IMMEDIATELY.","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_2_body_1":"They just got a shipment of limited edition Rum Runner's Rum and I hear it's delish!","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh great\u2026","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_10startdialog_4_body_0":"\u2026I'm going back to sleep.","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_20hint_0_body_0":"Hey! This is serious! Did I mention it's limited?!","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_60reward_0_body_0":"I wasn't soaked\u2026","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well sir, the barrels have been built and we even carved out some space in some of the ships for those secret compartments you requested.","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"The last thing I want is for my precious cargo to be pilfered by some Reef Bandits or something like that. You can't be too cautious in situations like this.","mis_n01_rumrunner_010_makebarrels_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Your approach to this situation was highly inappropriate, Morgan. You scared the daylights out of us! Perkins was soaked in tears!","mis_n01_rumrunner_020_portcity_10startdialog_0_body_0":"All ships ready? Let's get this over with as quickly and as soberly as possible.","mis_n01_rumrunner_020_portcity_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Captain Pike is going to help you sir, no problem. I really think\u2014","mis_n01_rumrunner_020_portcity_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Dammit Perkins! Make this thing go faster! Blow on the sails or something!","mis_n01_rumrunner_020_portcity_20hint_0_body_0":"And radio ahead! I don't want to stay too long.","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You know why I'm here, Pike. Don't make me beg.","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Of course Lieutenant Morgan! I'm more than happy to help. I've been in your situation before and it's not one I want to be in again.","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Now, I understand you're more of a whiskey man, but I can offer you the finest rum you've ever tasted!","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Just put it in the barrels Pike. Slowly. No sudden moves. We're both getting something we want. Let's not make a big deal out of this.","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_20hint_0_body_0":"There's just the matter of payment and you'll be on your way.","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_60reward_0_body_0":"One day, I'm going to talk to her\u2026","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_70enddialog_0_body_0":"It was wonderful doing business with you, Lieutenant! You and your men are welcome any time.","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Can we stay for a bit sir? I'd like to get to know some of the\u2014","mis_n01_rumrunner_030_buyrum_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Everyone! We're leaving! Perkins, deal with your crush on the translator on your own time. I've got important military drinking, er, thinking to do.","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, do you really think it was necessary to bring so many ships? Don't we run the risk of attracting unwanted attention?","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Think about it, Ramsey. We're transporting precious cargo across dangerous waters. I'm not about to risk anything. Besides who's gonna mess with this many ships?","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Sirs! We have Sovereign ships incoming!","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_20hint_0_body_0":"They might.","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_60reward_0_body_0":"Finally! Some concern for the cargo!","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ramsey, don't look at me like that. You were right, OK. It's called humility.","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_1_body_0":"\u2026","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We survived, didn't we? With minimal casualties?","mis_n01_rumrunner_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I'm just glad your alcohol is safe, sir.","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir? I don't think most of us Imperials were built for this sea travel stuff. So much\u2026 up and down\u2026","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, some of you guys look absolutely terrible. Tell you what. You go over there, away from me, hang your head over the side of the boat and let loose.","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Perkins isn't the only one affected by this, Morgan. We should look for a better solution. Maybe those Reef Bandits have a way of dealing with this.","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_20hint_0_body_0":"Alright? Let's grab that translator for this.","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_60reward_0_body_0":"\"Remedy soup\" you say?","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, that was fun. I'm guessing that was the welcoming committee?","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_70enddialog_1_body_0":"From what I've been able to gather, there are two factions of Reef Bandits. That must have been the\u2026 more aggressive group.","mis_n01_seasick_010_reefbandits_70enddialog_1_body_1":"There's a friendlier looking group on that beach. I'll go ask if they can help you Imperials out.","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_10startdialog_0_body_0":"They found the very notion of becoming sick by the motion of the sea laughable but they did offer some suggestions. I wrote them down in this list.","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Hmm, this looks like nothing more than a recipe for some vegetable soup? Am I missing something?","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Please, let me try it out sir. It's awful out there.","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_20hint_0_body_0":"\u2026Permission granted.","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_60reward_0_body_0":"Man, now I'm hungry for soup.","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I got the vegetables and made a big pot of soup with them. It smells delicious on land. I hope this works at sea.","mis_n01_seasick_020_medicine_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Alright, let's get this over with.","mis_n01_seasick_030_oceanmap_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Should I eat the soup now or wait until we're out over the water?","mis_n01_seasick_030_oceanmap_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm guessing now? Like one of those pills for allergies. It probably has some sort of vegetable time release thing going on.","mis_n01_seasick_030_oceanmap_20hint_0_body_0":"I think he means digestion?","mis_n01_seasick_030_oceanmap_70enddialog_0_body_0":"How are you feeling, Perkins? You still look fairly green\u2026","mis_n01_seasick_030_oceanmap_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ugh, now I feel full and nauseous, sir. It's even worse than before.","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright, well, since this was an utter failure and Perkins is curled in the fetal position next to a bucket, we should probably head back in to shore.","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We have enemy ships incoming sir. Look like Sovereign ships.","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wonderful. Hold on Perkins! Your nausea is going to be over soon, one way or another.","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Ugghhh\u2026 Blarrgghghrrgh!","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_60reward_0_body_0":"Huh, who knew it would be that simple?","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant, the men spotted this box floating among the debris from the enemy ships. It's labeled \"Motion Sickness Pills\".","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, that could be handy. At the very least we should be able to have Floyd reverse-engineer something from it. What are the ingredients?","mis_n01_seasick_040_seasickfight_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Looks like they're ginger tablets.","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lt. Morgan? I've noticed a growing problem that should be addressed soon but I need your permission to proceed.","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What is it this time, Perkins? Are we out of ham? Is there a shortage of tube socks?","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No sir. There are a lot of ships running aground at night near the Outpost so I thought we should build one of those giant shore night lights as a warning.","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_10startdialog_3_body_0":"It's called a Lighthouse Perkins, and I've already come up with a design I think is both cost effective and efficient.","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_20hint_0_body_0":"Permission granted for the \"giant shore night light\".","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_60reward_0_body_0":"Meh. You win some, you get blinded by others.","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perkins! Front and center! I need an update on that giant flashlight.","mis_n01_shipwreck_010_lighthouse_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ships crashing into the shore because of the dark are down 85%! Ships crashing into the shore because of being blinded by the light are up 100% though\u2026","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I bet we could find some useful military equipment on the seafloor after all those ships sunk. No point for it to go to waste.","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Hmm, we already have some diving gear and we could use some of the fishing nets to carry objects, but we'd need some sort of large crane to haul the \"useful military equipment\", as you called it, out of the water.","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I got this, LT. I could rig up somethin' simple with a crane and some pontoons to float it on.","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_20hint_0_body_0":"Does Perkins know how to swim? I guess we'll find out.","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_60reward_0_body_0":"We wouldn't want to go and have to salvage our salvage crane!","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well it turns out Perkins CAN swim, just not very well while wearing a hundred pounds of diving gear. Good thing we had that rope attached to him. I call it a successful test run.","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_70enddialog_0_body_1":"How's the crane looking Zoey?","mis_n01_shipwreck_020_scubagear_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ok, I guess? It'll float for sure but I may need to tone down the acceleration of the on-board motor. The whole structure's a bit top-heavy.","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, it seems some scruffy looking looters have moved in on our salvage area.","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Wait, what? They're going after OUR stuff? I won't stand for this! We have looters rights!","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Floyd, you're a learned man. Don't you know about Maritime Law and salvage rights or something?","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm more of an amateur enthusiast on Bird Law, but I do believe we're within our rights to defend our claim.","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_20hint_0_body_0":"Those guys are going down! Then we'll salvage their salvage they salvaged from us.","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_60reward_0_body_0":"Those guys had crappy looking boats. No wonder they want our stuff.","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We sunk or scared away all the scavengers, Lieutenant. Should we go after any of the stragglers?","mis_n01_shipwreck_030_defendsalvage_70enddialog_1_body_0":"No Sergeant, let them run. Just keep an eye out for more in case they show up again.","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lt. Morgan sir? Sovereign ships have been sighted in the area. Again.","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Man, these guys are relentless. How many times do we have to kick their butts before they leave us alone?","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Looks like they're being escorted by submarines Lieutenant. We should take care of this while we know their location.","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Alright Sergeant. Permission to engage granted.","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_20hint_0_body_0":"Why do they keep coming up here anyway?","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_60reward_0_body_0":"We could totally get to it if all that water wasn't in the way.","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_70enddialog_0_body_0":"And another victory for Imperial forces. Well done everyone.","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_70enddialog_0_body_1":"Wait. Did one of those subs not explode?","mis_n01_sunk_010_sovereignsubs_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I saw the same thing, Morgan. Looks like they scuttled it.","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_10startdialog_0_body_0":"OK, so, the abandoned sub is just sitting there on the seafloor and we can't get to it. Tying weights to Perkins' feet and lowering him down to the sub almost worked but I think we'll need a better solution.","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Why don't we use one of them divin' suits? That way he'll be able to breathe and not pass out like last time?","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I also recommend constructing a decompression chamber. Going that far down and then coming back up too quickly is highly dangerous. Potentially separating the nitrogen from\u2014","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Alright, permission granted to build those things. Just stop with the constant explanations, OK Floyd?","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_20hint_0_body_0":"We all know you're smart, jeeze.","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_60reward_0_body_0":"Um, thanks?","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The decompression chamber is complete and functioning. We can now safely send Perkins down as far as he'll go before being crushed by the sheer amount of water above him.","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Good stuff. We'll have to test those limits later. What about you Zoey?","mis_n01_sunk_020_deepdive_70enddialog_2_body_0":"The diving gear is ready to go LT! I even had enough time to attach this flamethrower to the left arm of the suit!","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey! What the hell are those Reef Bandits doing near our stuff?","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_10startdialog_1_body_0":"They're scavengers Lieutenant. This is what they do. We can't really blame them for that, can we?","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I can! Let 'em scavenge their own ships from the bottom of the ocean. I want that sub.","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_10startdialog_3_body_0":"On it, Lieutenant.","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_20hint_0_body_0":"Hey Reef Bandits! We'll give you something to scavenge!","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_60reward_0_body_0":"Can I get a flashlight or something? It's dark down there.","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, now that all the distractions are out of the way, let's get this salvage operation going. I wanna see that sub as soon as humanly possible!","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes sir, I'm still wearing the diving suit as you instructed me to. Did you know the helmet is bullet-proof? I do, now.","mis_n01_sunk_030_distraction_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Alright Perkins, let's get you into the water. Just like last time except this time you've got some oxygen!","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The sub's been hauled up, mostly intact too! Looks like there's only some minor damage. Oughtta be pretty easy to fix it up.","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Interesting. I wonder why it was abandoned if it was mostly functional? All the Sovereign guys are either gone or dead, right?","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yes Morgan, it appears that way. I'll do a thorough inspection of the interior to see what I can find.","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_20hint_0_body_0":"Don't be a trap, don't be a trap...","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_60reward_0_body_0":"Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright Floyd, what's the word? Is it a trap? I'm really hoping for some good news from all of this.","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Not that I can tell, Morgan. It appears as if the hatch wasn't properly secured and our attacks were able to jostle it open, flooding the interior.","mis_n01_sunk_040_subrepair_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wow, that sounds lucky for us. I guess in the end, we're all just people huh?","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_10startdialog_0_body_0":"After consulting with Captain Pike, we'll need a building to properly build naval ships. It sounds like we'll need many ships in the near future. Both for protection and for ferrying supplies to Pike.","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_10startdialog_1_body_0":"OK, let's get started then. A few days ago I was happily ignorant of the fact that people would bother crossing that much water and now I've been told that there's a hostile nation that wants our entire continent.","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Not even a 'hello' first.","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_20hint_0_body_0":"The Dry Dock can be found in the Build menu under the Military category.","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_60reward_0_body_0":"To be known as the place that launched a thousand ships!","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So, you don't build the ships directly in the water? I'm just saying, with how big some of these boats are, I'm not going to help you carry them to the water.","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That's the whole purpose of this facility, Morgan! Build them out of the water, where it's dry, then lower them in. Nobody will have to carry anything.","mis_n01_supplyrun_010_drydock_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I'm not sure it works that way, Floyd.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Scouts have reported some enemy ships on the horizon Lieutenant. It looks like they're searching for something. Probably Pike and his men.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Alright Ramsey. I guess now's as good a time as any to test out our water wings? Sea legs? You know what I mean.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_10startdialog_2_body_0":"If you'll allow me to accompany your men I could be of assistance. You may know how to fight on the land but I know a thing or two about sea warfare.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_10startdialog_3_body_0":"\u2026 Permission granted, but I get all the credit if things go well since it was my decision to allow you to go along.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_20hint_0_body_0":"Morgan can be really generous sometimes.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_60reward_0_body_0":"There will be many more battles. I guarantee it.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Yep, I knew we would win. If Imperials are good at anything it's war. I don't care what's under your feet.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_70enddialog_0_body_1":"Perkins! Stop vomiting!","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I can't help it sir. This constant up and down motion, it's like the worst roller-coaster I've ever been on.","mis_n01_supplyrun_020_destroyscouts_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I can't remember the last time I was nauseous. Just one more thing about me that's so impressive.","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_10startdialog_0_body_0":"LT, these boat repair kits ain't gonna cut it for much longer. Luckily I came up with some plans of my own on how to repair these boats in a massive facility.","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Hmm, like a boat hospital? I tell you what. You remove these scribbles about \"Automated Sentry Drones\" and I'll let you have at it. I hate robots.","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_10startdialog_2_body_0":"*sigh* Alright, if you're sure.","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_20hint_0_body_0":"You can find the Ship Repair Bay in the Military category!","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_60reward_0_body_0":"Ha ha, that's terrifying...","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All done, LT! Now we can repair our boats without havin' to make those repair kits.","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Excellent work, Zoey. I trust you also removed that extra bit we talked about? The robots?","mis_n01_supplyrun_030_shiprepair_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, LT. I'm gonna sneak 'em past you one of these days though!","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The ships we've faced so far have been mere scouts. After losing this many men I expect the leadership to start sending their more serious firepower soon.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Floyd an' me came up with some plans for some boats of our own with REAL firepower that we gotta get buildin' LT.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Zoey, I see that twinkle in your eye that usually means something is about to go horribly wrong, or horribly right. Either way, I'm going to stay away from the beach for the time being.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_20hint_0_body_0":"You can build the new ships at the Dry Dock.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_60reward_0_body_0":"He'll probably come around, eventually.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Excellent! Your Imperial craftsmanship seems more than sea-worthy. I'm beginning to feel as if death is no longer imminent for us!","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You're sounding more like an Imperial every day Pike.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I might have found that offensive at first, but not so much anymore. I get the feeling your Lieutenant Morgan isn't very fond of me though.","mis_n01_supplyrun_040_biggerboat_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Don't take it personal. You know more about sea warfare than he does and he's just a bit intimidated by that is all. Well, that and the fact that you brought a new, deadly enemy to our doorstep.","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Floyd you like collecting things, right?","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I've been known to dabble in the collection and categorization of certain items from time to\u2014","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's great. You see this list? I want you to gather up all these materials. Pike needs these supplies for his colony and since he gave the list to me, I'm pushing it off on you.","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I had several activities planned for this afternoon, but I suppose that will have to wait.","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_20hint_0_body_0":"Just go get the stuff, Floyd.","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_60reward_0_body_0":"These cabbages are heavy.","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Materials acquired and set aside.","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Follow Floyd and help load all of the stuff he's going to show you onto some of the ships. We need to take it down to Pike. Don't eat all the cabbage!","mis_n01_supplyrun_050_collectresources_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Perkins!","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hmmm, that appears to be\u2026 Yep. Warships. At the Outpost. Well that's just swell.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_10startdialog_0_body_1":"Ramsey! I need you to deal with this threat immediately. Nobody threatens an Imperial Outpost! Take Pike with you.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_10startdialog_1_body_0":"On it, Lieutenant. Pike! You're with me.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We shall lead our forces to victory, Sergeant! Then I believe a celebratory drink will be in order.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_20hint_0_body_0":"It's like Morgan has a twin.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_60reward_0_body_0":"We're also super humble.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The rate at which you Imperials can adapt to new situations is truly remarkable. I mean, just a short time ago you had no seafaring experience and now you have added another victory against the world's foremost naval force.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_70enddialog_0_body_1":"I was extremely lucky to make it to your Outpost.","mis_n01_supplyrun_060_seabattle_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, it's true. We are pretty great. Well, as long as it involves war.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Now that I have you here, Lieutenant, I have a favor to ask of you. Well more specifically Karin, our translator, has a favor. I'll let her explain.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Mr. Morgan? I was wondering if you and your military guys would help me make non-confrontational contact with the indigenous population we call the Reef Bandits? See, I want to establish communications between us.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It's Lieutenant, by the way. I worked very hard to achieve this rank, young lady. Why do you want to talk to those guys? They just seem like your typical displaced peoples. Violent and angry.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's exactly my point Lieutenant! It's partly our fault they're in this situation! I want to help if I can. Also the fact that it's a new language for me to learn! So exciting!","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well you definitely seem enthusiastic. Ramsey! We're moving out! Perkins! Help Karin with her stuff.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_20hint_0_body_0":"So, Karin? Have I introduced myself yet?","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_60reward_0_body_0":"OK sir, I see them, and they see us too!","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We usually find them in this area on a pretty regular basis. We think they use it as their fishing area.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I'm not seeing them yet\u2026","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Perkins. Scout around the area, let me know if you see anything.","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Um, sir? How exactly am I supposed to \"scout around\" while aboard a ship?","mis_n01_talknative_010_contact_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I don't know, climb something! Something really tall. Don't fall off!","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Reef Bandits have spotted us sir! They're coming this way!","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Boda! Boda fen fen cho! Tuko mo lassy gren di waul! Ri lo hauny!","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Karin? What's this guy yelling about? He seems super pissed and I don't like it when I'm being yelled at by people waving knives and fishing poles!","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I\u2026 I'm trying\u2026 Something about attacking? I think they're going to attack us. We've disturbed their \"hunting grounds\"...?","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Man, this guy isn't letting up. Alright I've had enough. Ramsey! Take 'em out!","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh no! Wait!","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_60reward_0_body_0":"OK, I think I got the basics.","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, they certainly are a lot quieter after they've been shot a few times. Can you make any sense of their language yet Karin? We're kind of counting on you here.","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I'm trying Lieutenant Morgan. It's very different from other languages I've encountered.","mis_n01_talknative_020_speak_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, make it quick, will you? Most of these guys aren't dead and avoiding another fight would be awesome.","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, yeah, when I said they were going to attack? Yeah, it turns out they were just upset that we disturbed the hunting grounds of a local predator. That predator is the one who's going to attack.","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Wow, really?","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yeah. I kind of screwed that one up. Sorry.","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_10startdialog_3_body_0":"About that predator thing you were talking about? Is that going to attack us? Why am I asking, of course it is.","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_20hint_0_body_0":"Yeah, it's that big thing in the water...","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_60reward_0_body_0":"You guys are exciting!","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, that was horrible. New rule everybody! We establish communications with a people BEFORE we give the order to fire. I want to know that they're actually trying to kill us first.","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_70enddialog_0_body_1":"Unless they shoot at us. Then it's self explanatory.","mis_n01_talknative_030_speakagain_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Good call, sir.","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Boda! Nos da asche?! Tuko mo dern fen da clak clak! Grota na mabels tac tac!","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Karin? A little help here?","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_10startdialog_2_body_0":"The, uh, Chief here is upset that you guys destroyed a lot of their fishing gear during that little scuffle earlier. He's demanding compensation. I think.","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, well that should be easy to remedy.","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_60reward_0_body_0":"Meh, I still chalk this one up as a win.","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright Chief, we decided to do the right thing and got some stuff together for you. We're sorry for breaking your things and shooting your guys.","mis_n01_talknative_040_buystuff_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ay, sankk na mimmo. O dem kiki verg.

I got a message from Karin. She has some important news for us and wants us to meet her and the Reef Bandit Chief at the Fishing Grounds.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_10startdialog_0_body_1":"She also said we should bring some sort of gift for the Reef Bandits.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Like what? Some veggies or something? Also, Ramsey? What are the odds this is a trap?","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I don't see that being likely here, sir. Perkins' girlfriend doesn't strike me as the devious type.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hey! She's not my girlfriend!","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh we know Perkins. Burn.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_60reward_0_body_0":"Well, we wouldn't want to make this too easy would we?","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wada ferm de fen fen chos. Boka di creen alm fa shope.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_70enddialog_1_body_0":"OK Chief. O'n tronbo fem gro.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_70enddialog_1_body_1":"The Chief says that as long as you both steer clear of each other they won't attack you if you give them the same courtesy.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Seems reasonable. I can agree to those terms.","mis_n01_talknative_050_truce_70enddialog_3_body_0":"He also said that you may encounter other hostile groups that he doesn't control.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir? We've received a message from Captain Pike. He wants to set up a trade route between The Outpost and his city.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Huh, that's odd. I'm used to having the people we contact try to sever all connection with us, not encourage further partnership. I wonder what the catch is.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We both have common goals Morgan. It's not a bad thing to have allies.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_10startdialog_3_body_0":"He then goes on to say that the route is currently too dangerous and needs our help to secure it.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh so that's the catch.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_60reward_0_body_0":"You guys better order lots of expensive stuff.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well Pike, I hope you're satisfied. We once again risked our boats to get here, but the path should be clear for the time being.","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_70enddialog_1_body_0":"This is going to be a net-positive for both of us Lieutenant, you'll see! Sure it may be a little difficult at first but us, working together, it's going to be glorious!","mis_n01_traderoutes_010_buildcargo_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You do realize we have other things going on right? Deadly Rebels, murderous Raiders, and those Silver Wolf jerks. We can't be spending all our time splashing around in the water with you.","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We've received our first orders from Port City. Simple tools and such. Nothing too fancy.","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Kind of an underwhelming first order, isn't it? Tools are boring, Floyd. Where's the pizazz? The flash?","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You've entered the exciting world of trade, Morgan! Give it some time. Not every order is going to be for a death-ray or large amount of explosives.","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_20hint_0_body_0":"Wait, you have a death-ray you're holding out on me?","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_60reward_0_body_0":"Don't think I forgot about that death-ray either...","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Everything has been loaded up, sirs. The first order is ready to launch as soon as you give the word.","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I mean, I guess I understand the need for some basic, boring stuff, but not even a little weapons cache on the side? Just for fun?","mis_n01_traderoutes_020_makesupplies_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It's about building up infrastructure, Morgan. Necessities before luxuries!","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey Perkins! Any word from Port City? It feels like things have been quiet lately.","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yes sir, we received a message this morning. Their production is a little slower than they want and would like some help if we can offer it.","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Uh, I guess we can help? I've got nothing better going on right now anyway.","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_20hint_0_body_0":"Can we charge him for the boat mileage? Is that a thing?","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_60reward_0_body_0":"Wait, what the hell just happened?","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We appreciate the assistance Lieutenant. It's important to have allies in tough times such as these.","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_70enddialog_0_body_1":"Know that any time you or other Imperials need our help, we'll be there.","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, yeah, no problem. Helping is its own reward and all that. So, about compensation\u2026","mis_n01_traderoutes_030_assist_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh don't worry about that! You don't owe us a thing. We'll consider it a gift. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some important matters to attend to.","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_0_body_0":"It's been happening more and more frequently Lieutenant. Those Reef Bandits keep picking off our ships along the trade route. We need a show of force, sir.","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Alright Ramsey, I'm open to suggestions. What do you propose?","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Armed escort, sir. We send down some of our war ships with the next shipment. Show those Bandits that you lose when you mess with Imperials.","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sounds like a solid plan. I'll come along as well. You never know when you'll need a military genius with you.","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_20hint_0_body_0":"Imperials! Get ready to move out!","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_60reward_0_body_0":"Someone get Perkins the training manual.","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We took care of the enemy ships and were able to keep all of our cargo ships afloat. We shouldn't have any other obstacles on our way to Port City.","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Excellent news Ramsey. Now I think the time is right for some on-ship entertainment. Perkins! Entertainment Routine Alpha!","mis_n01_traderoutes_040_protectcargo_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I keep telling you sir, I don't know what that is!","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Port City is in sight, sir! It looks like Captain Pike is waiting at the dock. He looks concerned about something.","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh great. He better be waiting to give us all kinds of praise for saving his cargo.","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Perkins, look less green. That's an order.","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_20hint_0_body_0":"I just want off this boat...","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_60reward_0_body_0":"What, no ice?","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, here we are again. Braving troubled waters to ensure safe passage for the cargo ships. We should really get a medal.","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_70enddialog_1_body_0":"It's nice to see you too, Lieutenant. As always, we appreciate your assistance. Please join me for a drink if you would.","mis_n01_traderoutes_050_escortcomplete_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, if you insist. It was a long and treacherous journey after all.","mis_n02_beach_010_jobs_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Zoooooeeeey! We're booorrrrrred! Will you take us to the beach? We wanna search for buried treasure!","mis_n02_beach_010_jobs_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I ain't sure how much buried treasure there is out there, but we can check. Let me get a couple things together for ya.","mis_n02_beach_010_jobs_20hint_0_body_0":"Yay! We're gonna be rich!","mis_n02_beach_010_jobs_60reward_0_body_0":"Let's find that buried treasure!","mis_n02_beach_010_jobs_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wow, Zoey! These metal detectors are awesome! The blinky lights are so cool looking!","mis_n02_beach_010_jobs_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, they do look pretty cool. You kids ready to have some fun at the beach? I'm gonna keep an eye on y'all from this hut.","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Zoey! We found something! This is the coolest looking treasure chest I've ever seen! I wonder what's inside it\u2026","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Whoa there, kids! That ain't no treasure chest at all. That's an explosive mine. Must'a washed ashore.","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's even cooler! But ... how do we play with it?","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, that parts simple. We're gonna blow it up! It'd be dangerous to just leave it here.","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_20hint_0_body_0":"Best beach trip ever!","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_60reward_0_body_0":"Oh, alright then. I'm going back to bed.","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What's all the commotion out here? I was trying to instruct Perkins on the proper way to fold my tube socks when we were interrupted by a giant explosion.","mis_n02_beach_020_mine_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That was us, LT. The kids found a mine that got washed ashore. We blew it up. For safety.","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Zoey? Did you guys bury some metal pipes in the ground near the beach? This definitely doesn't look like a treasure chest\u2026","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What in the heck are you kids talkin' bout now?","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_10startdialog_1_body_1":"OH! Yeah, guys, you should move away from that before you wake it up\u2026","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh no! It's moving! What happened?","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_20hint_0_body_0":"This ain't gonna be pretty.","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_60reward_0_body_0":"Ok fine, but you have to bring a full platoon with you next time.","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_70enddialog_0_body_0":"First, large explosions! Then, you find robot monsters and somehow activate them!","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_70enddialog_0_body_1":"I'm not usually one to put my foot down, but you kids are officially banned from playing on this beach. I don't know if the Outpost can take much more.","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_70enddialog_1_body_0":"But! We didn't mean to! It was an accident!","mis_n02_beach_030_arms_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, LT. They didn't mean nuthin' by it. It's a good thing they found this stuff when they did. What if those things woke up when we were all sleepin'?","mis_n02_error_010_translate_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, sir? The Reef Bandit Chief is on the radio again, but I can't make out what he wants. Permission to contact Karin to help translate?","mis_n02_error_010_translate_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I can't take it anymore, Floyd! I'm tired of relying on others for simple things like communicating with other people. I don't wanna do it anymore.","mis_n02_error_010_translate_10startdialog_2_body_0":"What in the blazes are you vociferating about now?","mis_n02_error_010_translate_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I want you to build me some sort of machine that will translate whatever sounds those Reef Bandits are making into speech that I can understand!","mis_n02_error_010_translate_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I'm going to ignore the fact that this probably isn't possible with the materials I have available, and trudge on regardless. I may require Zoey's help with this.","mis_n02_error_010_translate_20hint_0_body_0":"So, it'll be ready by Tuesday?","mis_n02_error_010_translate_60reward_0_body_0":"Sir? Should I still contact Karin?","mis_n02_error_010_translate_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All done, LT! Golly, that contraption was a tall order, but I think we worked it out. You should'a seen how big the first one was!","mis_n02_error_010_translate_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Man, this thing is huge. Will it actually translate the Reef Bandits' language? It's not going to explode, is it?","mis_n02_error_010_translate_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It should work as intended. Now, granted, computing technology is still somewhat basic, but we managed to get this machine down to a respectable size.","mis_n02_error_020_floats_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Floyd, Zoey, I want you two to figure out a way to get this behemoth to the Reef Bandit Chief. We can't keep it here. The Reef Bandits never visit and it totally contrasts with the motif we've got going on.","mis_n02_error_020_floats_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This thing might sink one of our boats if we load it on one. I reckon a little extra float's gonna be necessary.","mis_n02_error_020_floats_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Good idea, Zoey. I'll see what we can do about that.","mis_n02_error_020_floats_20hint_0_body_0":"Yeah, you guys go do that. I'll be here.","mis_n02_error_020_floats_60reward_0_body_0":"Yeah, well it smells like fish parts.","mis_n02_error_020_floats_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This thing stinks, Floyd. Why does this giant computer thing of yours smell so bad?","mis_n02_error_020_floats_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I ran into a problem where the main circuits would overheat too easily and current methods of drawing the heat out were insufficient. I had to utilize a\u2026 less than conventional method.","mis_n02_error_030_attract_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Um, LT? Did you feel that? Like somethin' brushed up against the boat?","mis_n02_error_030_attract_10startdialog_1_body_0":"No, but admittedly, I wasn't feeling very hard. Let me try a bit harder\u2026","mis_n02_error_030_attract_10startdialog_1_body_1":"OK, I felt that one. Ramsey! Get the men ready for a fight! I think we're going to have company soon.","mis_n02_error_030_attract_20hint_0_body_0":"Oo rah!","mis_n02_error_030_attract_60reward_0_body_0":"That sounds horribly terrible.","mis_n02_error_030_attract_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright Floyd. What exactly did you fill this thing with? Why is it attracting giant Groupers? What did you do?","mis_n02_error_030_attract_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, your \"fish parts\" comment wasn't too far off. I've found that if you indiscriminately throw multiple types of aquatic life into a big vat and make a slurry out of it, the slurry has all sorts of applications.","mis_n02_error_040_gift_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hello, Chief! We bring you a great gift! This giant contraption can translate our words so we can understand each other! Don't worry about the smell.","mis_n02_error_040_gift_10startdialog_0_body_1":".... Floyd, why isn't the machine working?","mis_n02_error_040_gift_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh yes! Uh, we need to plug it in\u2026 somewhere. Does anyone see a power outlet?","mis_n02_error_040_gift_10startdialog_2_body_0":"*sigh* Lokka met tera.","mis_n02_error_040_gift_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, I'm embarrassed. You really outdid yourself this time, Floyd. Let's get this piece of junk out of here and go home.","mis_n02_error_040_gift_20hint_0_body_0":"But it works! I assure you, it does!","mis_n02_error_050_bully_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Uh, Lieutenant Morgan, sir? I've been monitoring radio chatter in the area and managed to pick up some Sovereign signals. They've heard about the translator and they want it pretty bad.","mis_n02_error_050_bully_10startdialog_1_body_0":"So, they're going to attack us then? And soon, I'm guessing?","mis_n02_error_050_bully_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yes sir. I think that's them on the horizon, actually.","mis_n02_error_050_bully_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm blaming you for this, Floyd!","mis_n02_error_050_bully_60reward_0_body_0":"Alright, LT...","mis_n02_error_050_bully_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright, I'm done with this thing. Melt it down. Scrap it, get rid of it. I hate it and its fishy smell and, I don't want to see any part of it ever again.","mis_n02_error_050_bully_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Destroying this machine would be a huge injustice, Morgan. The circuitry inside is highly sophisticated and a great feat of modern engineering.","mis_n02_error_050_bully_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Alright Floyd, I hear you. I won't make you destroy it. Zoey! Destroy this thing.","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Look everyone! Perkins is back from his date with Karin!","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Uh, it wasn't a date, actually. She made that very clear. But oh! We saw something incredible!","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_10startdialog_1_body_1":"We visited the Reef Bandits for some research she was doing and they had these Groupers trained to do all sorts of things! Even fight for them!","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wait, wait, wait. They trained Groupers to fight for them? And it worked? We should totally do that!","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_20hint_0_body_0":"Hey Floyd! We're gonna need some stuff to catch some Groupers.","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_60reward_0_body_0":"I'll take your word for it.","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I don't know much about fishing nets, Floyd, but these look super sturdy. Are you sure they'll be able to hold a Grouper?","mis_n02_grouper_010_trip_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Indeed, it should be no problem. The trick was to be extra encouraging when weaving the fibers.","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Just think, Floyd. Wave after wave of emotionless aquatic killers at our disposal! The Sovereign won't know what hit 'em.","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Your statement seems a little premature, Morgan. We haven't even captured one yet. Let alone built a facility\u2014","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Jeeze Floyd, can't you ever just bask in the glow of a good idea? Why do you always have to kill the mood with talk of \"plans\" and thinking ahead?","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_20hint_0_body_0":"Since when is appropriate planning a mood killer?","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_60reward_0_body_0":"Uh, can I at least get a hose or something?","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Baby Groupers captured and stowed safely on board, sir!","mis_n02_grouper_020_catch_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Perfect! Keep 'em moist, Perkins. I don't want these things drying out and dying before we get home. Grouper jerky doesn't sound very appetizing.","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir? We need to get these fish off the boat and into an aquarium or something. They're not looking too good after that trip.","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I hear you, Perkins. Floyd, did you hear that? We need a giant water tank to put these fish into. Hop to it.","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'll build your facility but keep in mind, I'm not formally a member of your military. You can't just throw orders at me like one of your soldiers.","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Get a move on, Floyd! The fish could die!","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_10startdialog_3_body_1":"That's an order!","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_20hint_0_body_0":"*grumble*","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_60reward_0_body_0":"They're more machine now than beast. Well, besides all the organic matter.","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_70enddialog_0_body_0":"These fish are pretty smart after bein' all trained up. I named the fat one \"Fatty\" and the skinny one \"Scrappy\".","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You probably shouldn't be naming these things, Zoey. I don't want you getting too attached, y'know?","mis_n02_grouper_030_pen_70enddialog_2_body_0":"He's right, Zoey. These are tools of war now. Any shred of animality they once had has been ripped out and replaced with military commands.","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, sir?","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Y'know Perkins, I'm THIS CLOSE to finishing my crossword puzzle. Do you have the answer to 4 Across? Because if not\u2014","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No sir, it's just that our harbor patrols have reported some large Groupers in the water near the Outpost. Almost like they're searching for something.","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_20hint_0_body_0":"What would Groupers be searching for around our \u2026 oh.","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_60reward_0_body_0":"That's especially horrible.","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well Morgan, I hope you've learned a valuable lesson from all of this.","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yep, totally. From now on, we only use orphans. No parents to get in the way.","mis_n02_grouper_040_parents_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wow ...","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant, some of the men are getting anxious being stuck on the ships for so long. They want some leave time to blow off some steam.","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That seems like a decent enough idea, but those rags you're currently wearing aren't gonna cut it.","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_20hint_0_body_0":"Rags? But these are standard issue Imperial battle garments.","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_60reward_0_body_0":"Is the Sarge struttin'?","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ah! Much better! Now you'll no longer be an embarrassment to the entire Outpost!","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I thought I liked the way I looked, but I have to admit, this new uniform gives me a certain\u2026confidence I didn't have before.","mis_n02_leave_010_rags_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, I'm making Perkins go with you. I can't think of a reasonable excuse why right now. Mainly it's to get him away from me.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Everyone listen up! We've got limited time to spend in Port City so I'm going to lay down some ground rules. First, represent the Empire with dignity and respect. If someone challenges you to a drinking contest, you gotta do it.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_10startdialog_0_body_1":"Second, Imperials never back down. If someone tries to start something with you, lay 'em out.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Um, Sergeant? I don't know if these are the best rules to be following when we're away from the Outpost. Things could get out of hand.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_10startdialog_2_body_0":"This brings me to rule number three. Direct all authority figures to Perkins if you get into any trouble. He'll take care of it.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_20hint_0_body_0":"What? Wait! No!","mis_n02_leave_020_port_60reward_0_body_0":"Oh, that part was completely serious.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Things are going smoother than I thought they would. I'm having a pretty fun time so far!","mis_n02_leave_020_port_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Great. We might as well enjoy ourselves while we're here. And listen, I was just giving you a hard time with those rules earlier. I just wanted to wind you up a bit.","mis_n02_leave_020_port_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh good! I was worried you were serious about the drinking contests and the fighting.","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Um, Sergeant Ramsey? Maybe you should let the locals win this round? They're starting to get a bit upset\u2026","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"\u2026*hic* Don't worry about it, Per\u2026 Purrface? Hahaha! You're not a cat\u2026","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh man, you're looking a little worse for wear, sir. I think we should get out of here before anything\u2014","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_10startdialog_3_body_0":"HA! You losers! I win again! Kiss my behind!","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Before anything like that happens...","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_60reward_0_body_0":"How'd my new uniform get all messed up?","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I was a little out of it there for a minute. Guess I just needed a little adrenaline to get me going again.","mis_n02_leave_030_barfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, we survived, so I guess that's a plus.","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Oh, my head. I think I've done enough drinking and fighting for a while.","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_10startdialog_1_body_0":"My whole self hurts.","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Let's get you guys home.","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_20hint_0_body_0":"On a boat? Oh great...","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_60reward_0_body_0":"Lightweights.","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Welcome back! Wow, you guys look terrible. Anyone wanna have a drink with me?","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_70enddialog_1_body_0":"*urp*","mis_n02_leave_040_bruised_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh god no\u2026","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_10startdialog_0_body_1":"I just got word from our cargo ships that your latest rum shipment from Port City was attacked by a giant Grouper near the trade route.","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Lieutenant Morgan!","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What! My rum's gone?! We MUST find this giant fish. I will not rest until I bring the damned thing to justice!","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Uh, sir? Are you alright? You've got this REALLY intense look in your eyes and it's kind of unsettling.","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_20hint_0_body_0":"I have been wounded. It's like I'm missing a leg.","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_60reward_0_body_0":"OK, I just finished processing what I said to you and your concerns may be valid.","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All that stuff you asked for has been loaded onto some of the ships, Lieutenant. I gotta caution you though, sir. Don't let this become an obsession. It's not healthy.","mis_n02_moby_010_rum_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ramsey, relax. When have I ever taken things too far? I'm just going to go after this fish, come hell or high water, possibly dying in the process\u2026","mis_n02_moby_020_beast_10startdialog_0_body_0":"No sign of the alleged Grouper yet, sir.","mis_n02_moby_020_beast_10startdialog_1_body_0":"So, it's going to be like that, is it? Alright, fine. Take out the next Groupers you see. We'll draw him out.","mis_n02_moby_020_beast_20hint_0_body_0":"This feels unethical, but Floyd did say these things are jerks so...","mis_n02_moby_020_beast_60reward_0_body_0":"I hate the smell of Grouper chow in the morning...","mis_n02_moby_020_beast_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Still no sign of it, sir. Should we head back to the Outpost?","mis_n02_moby_020_beast_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Head back? We haven't even seen the thing yet! Just continue chumming the water with that Grouper chow. It'll show up. I can feel it.","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The monster has been sighted, sir! Off our port side!","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Bring us around, helmsman! This giant beast is going to pay for destroying that shipment of perfectly good liquor!","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_20hint_0_body_0":"You're not getting away from me, BEAST!","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_60reward_0_body_0":"Why wouldn't he want gold?","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_70enddialog_0_body_0":"It's down, sir. You've accomplished your goal.","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I was really hoping for a more satisfying ending here. I mean, we didn't even get its life story. We know he destroys things, but why? Parental issues? Lust for gold? These are the deep questions.","mis_n02_moby_030_revenge_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Why would a fish want gold?","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_10startdialog_0_body_0":"This situation must be dealt with, Lieutenant. My city has been under siege by a new class of submarine we've never seen before. And we're not the only settlement to have been attacked either.","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Look, Pike, I'm all for keeping the waters safe, and yeah, I've been getting some similar reports. But our equipment hasn't been able to pick anything up yet. We can't attack what we can't find.","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_10startdialog_2_body_0":"About that, LT. I been thinkin' about ways to make Floyd's sonar a bit more sensitive. I 'spose I could fix it up a bit.","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_20hint_0_body_0":"Why does that make me nervous?","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_60reward_0_body_0":"\u2026 Alright, sure, whatever.","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So, what exactly does this thing do, Zoey?","mis_n02_newsub_010_threat_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, the sonar machine normally blasts out sound waves, then listens for the echo of the sound waves after they bounce offa sumthin'. Well, it enhances that and makes it do a better job.","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_10startdialog_0_body_0":"It's working, sir! We've spotted the enemy subs on the sonar. Whatever Zoey did is working!","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Once again, we've been helped by the unexplainable magics of Science! It really is capable of miracles in the proper hands.","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_10startdialog_2_body_0":"What about in the improper hands?","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_20hint_0_body_0":"Explosions, mostly.","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_60reward_0_body_0":"Yes, I leave all secret plans just laying around.","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_70enddialog_0_body_0":"OK, those looked like the same old subs we've been facing. Pike? I thought you said there was a new type of sub showing up. Did you hear about them while still a Sovereign or something?","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Nothing official, no, but keep in mind that was several years ago. I know what I saw, Lieutenant. They've obviously developed some new technology since then.","mis_n02_newsub_020_blip_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Damn, I was hoping you had some secret construction plans laying around that we could use to make our own.","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey LT! I got an idea you might wanna know about for how ta keep them new submarines away from the Outpost.","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Zoey, you're by far my most valuable asset at this entire Outpost, and I appreciate anything you can do to strategically enhance our place in this world.","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Now, having said that, I can tell you that most of what you do scares the crap out of me. Is this improvement you're talking about going to be dangerous?","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Not ta us, no. Only the people in the subs near our Outpost.","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_20hint_0_body_0":"Or any animals in the water. Pretty much anythin' in the water.","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_60reward_0_body_0":"Thanks LT!","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Zoey, great job taking something that Floyd cobbled together and making it more useful. That's the kind of thing I like to see.","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I've just inspected the \"enhancements\" Zoey added to my sonar device and I must say it is truly appalling! Anything in the water remotely near our Outpost is either going to go deaf or be driven mad from the noise!","mis_n02_newsub_030_loud_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wow \u2026 that sounds ... pretty amazing actually. Well done, Zoey.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_10startdialog_0_body_0":"This can't be right. Zoey! Get in here! Why am I seeing a whole bunch of fancy looking subs in the bay near the Outpost? I thought your enhancements were supposed to keep these things away?","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, it is supposed to do that\u2026 I don't understand what's goin' on.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I believe I can help. After further examination of Zoey's enhancements I've concluded that the machine does not have an ample power supply to act in the manner for which\u2014","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Quicker, Floyd.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_10startdialog_4_body_0":"It's currently acting more like a beacon. An underwater lighthouse, if you will. Telling everyone in the area exactly where we are.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_20hint_0_body_0":"Wait, like, everyone everyone?","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_60reward_0_body_0":"I mean, look at Perkins! He messes up all the time and he's still here.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I trust you believe me about the new type of submarines now, Lieutenant?","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, Pike. Seeing is believing. I saw and now I believe.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Zoey? Please turn off that signal beacon of yours. I'd rather not have to fight more of those things for a while.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Sure thing, LT. I'm real sorry 'bout all the trouble I caused.","mis_n02_newsub_040_attack_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Zoey, I still have faith in you and your abilities. We all make mistakes from time to time.","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey Floyd, I had a thought. We have too many enemies around here. I bet if we gave the Reef Bandits some super nice gifts they'd want to form an alliance! Then we can focus on just the Sovereign trying to kill us!","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_10startdialog_1_body_0":"And what, exactly, are you going to give them to win them over?","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Leave that to me, Floyd. If there's one thing I know after years of slaughtering countless indigenous peoples, it's what they want.","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm guessing \"not being slaughtered\" isn't on that list?","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_60reward_0_body_0":"I want no part in this.","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_70enddialog_0_body_0":"There we go! Nobody could stay mad at us after we give them such generous gifts!","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_70enddialog_1_body_0":"This is perhaps the most insulting set of gifts I've ever seen, Morgan, which is really saying something considering it's coming from you. \"Sorry you lost your home. Have some beads and scratchy blankets.\"","mis_n02_peace_010_beads_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I'm not sure I know what you mean by that. Did you feel those blankets? Super soft.","mis_n02_peace_020_return_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, sir? That package you sent to the Reef Bandits came back with this note attached. The box looks like it's been kicked a bunch, too.","mis_n02_peace_020_return_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh man, these blankets have been practically kicked apart, and the beads are all scuffed up. What does the note say? Can you even read it?","mis_n02_peace_020_return_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yes sir, I had Karin help me translate it over the radio. It basically says that your gift was terrible and insulting. If you want to send anything, they need clean water and food and safety more than anything else.","mis_n02_peace_020_return_20hint_0_body_0":"But that sounds hard!","mis_n02_peace_020_return_60reward_0_body_0":"If looks could wound, I'd probably have another facial scar.","mis_n02_peace_020_return_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright, Chief. We got you something you actually want this time. I hope you enjoy it.","mis_n02_peace_020_return_70enddialog_1_body_0":"\u2026","mis_n02_peace_020_return_70enddialog_2_body_0":"He looks skeptical, sir.","mis_n02_peace_025_boars_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, sir! We just received word from the Reef Bandits that your second gift attempt was a huge success! \u00a0Especially the bacon!","mis_n02_peace_025_boars_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This is a surprise to no one. Bacon is delicious.","mis_n02_peace_025_boars_10startdialog_2_body_0":"They'd like some more, sir. In fact, they asked to have a few boars of their own so they won't have to ask us again.","mis_n02_peace_025_boars_20hint_0_body_0":"I guess that's fine. They better pay us this time.","mis_n02_peace_025_boars_60reward_0_body_0":"They're so adorable I could eat them!","mis_n02_peace_025_boars_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perfect! Let's get these delicious future-meals to the Reef Bandits!","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Groupers spotted, sir! And they look hungry!","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This is a surprise to no one. Bacon's delicious.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_10startdialog_2_body_0":"They'd like some more, sir. In fact, they asked to have a few boars of their own so they won't have to ask us again.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_20hint_0_body_0":"I think the Groupers want some bacon, too.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_60reward_0_body_0":"I've completed my good deed for the day.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright, Chief, enjoy your boars. I hope this shows you that we can be pretty cool. We had to fight off a bunch of hostile groupers to get here.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Boda, teng gu fen lo.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, that's probably true.","mis_n02_peace_030_bacon_70enddialog_2_body_1":"Alright everyone! Let's get out of here!","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_10startdialog_0_body_1":"This is unexpected\u2026 and probably not a good sign.","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Pike? What are you doing here?","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Astute as ever, Lieutenant. It would seem that several of the Reef Bandit colonies in the area have gone completely silent. Not a word from them in some time.","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'd bet the Chief knows what's going on. We should go talk to him.","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh yeah, sure. We'll just drop whatever it is we're doing and get right on it.","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_60reward_0_body_0":"It's happening again. This is why I left...","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Enda bo teengu. Mafu sot tog tog. Nen no balics.","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_70enddialog_1_body_0":"According to the Chief here, someone or something has been destroying the other Reef Bandit colonies. He hasn't heard what, exactly, as there have been no survivors.","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wow, really?\u00a0But you Reef Bandits are pretty tough customers. I've seen you in action. Who could be behind this?","mis_n02_rbarmy_010_silence_70enddialog_3_body_0":"We won't know for sure until we can track them down. We should venture to some other colonies and check on their situation.","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The Chief's asked us to check out the Fishing Grounds. He said there should be a small group of Reef Bandits there we can ask if they've seen anything worrying.","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Let's get a move on then. For all we know they might be under attack right now from whatever took out those other Bandit groups.","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_20hint_0_body_0":"We have to help these people.","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_60reward_0_body_0":"Then, we go after whoever is behind this.","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Other than the ships we just took out, I'm not seeing anyone else. No Reef Bandits, just debris. We're too late. There's no way to tell for sure if it was the Sovereign Navy or if they were just passing through.","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_70enddialog_1_body_0":"This is unacceptable! We need to scour the wreckage. Find some information! Something!","mis_n02_rbarmy_020_fishing_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Pike, I know this isn't what you want to hear right now, but we're doing what we can. The best course of action is to check in on the next group we can find. We need to find survivors.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Give me some good news, Perkins.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Uh, I wish I could sir\u2026 I'm not able to raise any Reef Bandits on the radio using the frequencies I got from the Chief. It's possible the radios were disabled or broken though.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Possible, but unlikely. We need to visit the Trade Routes. There's a friendly colony there we can talk to that might be able to give us more information.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_20hint_0_body_0":"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_60reward_0_body_0":"I had hoped with my departure from the Sovereign, their search would stop.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Nothing, sirs. Just more debris. It's like the whole place has been wiped out. I think we can say for sure it's the Sovereign Navy though, at this point.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I refuse to believe we're too late. There have to be some survivors.","mis_n02_rbarmy_030_searching_70enddialog_2_body_0":"If there are any survivors, they aren't around here. We need to move on. There's no point in staying here.","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The attacks continue, Lieutenant. We can't keep chasing the Sovereign all over the seas, constantly one step behind. There has to be a better solution.","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh, there is. I've been thinking of a plan but we're going to need help from the Chief and any Reef Bandits he can contact.","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_10startdialog_2_body_0":"The Chief says he's willing to do whatever it takes to get the attacks to stop. Just let him know.","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_10startdialog_3_body_0":"It's simple, really. They want to attack and destroy Reef Bandits, right? Well let's give them a target. First things first. We're gonna need some new boats.","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_20hint_0_body_0":"Ai, mei ne lo.","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_60reward_0_body_0":"Those are some fine looking killing machines...","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You have your boats, Lieutenant. What, may I ask, is the next step in this plan of yours?","mis_n02_rbarmy_040_steps_70enddialog_1_body_0":"One thing at a time, Pike. Give me a moment to admire the new weapons we just built.","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Part two of my genius plan involves disguising some of our troops as Reef Bandits while our ships are hidden nearby. When they come to attack, we spring the trap.","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This plan is either madness or brilliance. I suppose we won't find out which until it's too late to back out.","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, that's pretty much how all of Morgan's plans end up.","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_20hint_0_body_0":"This'll work, you'll see.","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_60reward_0_body_0":"Well, we are going fishing, in a way.","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_70enddialog_0_body_0":"How do the Reef Bandit disguises feel?","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Mine's bunching up in uncomfortable places\u2026","mis_n02_rbarmy_050_threads_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I feel like I'm about to go fishing or something.","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_10startdialog_0_body_0":"This next bit is the easy part. We need to sail to one of the Reef Bandit colonies and then we simply wait for them to come to us.","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That sounds simple enough, but unfortunately I need to return to my home. I can't leave my city unguarded in case those scoundrels show up. I'll leave Karin with you to help translate. Please keep her safe.","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_20hint_0_body_0":"Yes sir!","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_60reward_0_body_0":"Stay alert. They could show up soon, or hours from now.","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright Karin, now that we're here, let the Chief know we're hiding our ships in that alcove over there, then we wait.","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_70enddialog_1_body_0":"The Chief wants to know what you would like him and his men to do in the mean time.","mis_n02_rbarmy_060_waiting_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Act normal, do Reef Bandit stuff. Fishing, I guess? I don't know how long this is going to take.","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir! I've got Captain Pike on the radio! He says it's urgent that he speak to you right away!","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Give me that radio, Perkins. Pike? What's the big idea? Do you have any idea what time it is?","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, yes. It appears to be noon, Lieutenant.","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_10startdialog_3_body_0":"...Yeah, well we're on military time here, so, what do you want?","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_10startdialog_4_body_0":"If you would be so kind, some Reef Bandits have absconded with some of my cargo ships. I need you to track them down for me, and I need the cargo ships intact.","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_20hint_0_body_0":"Pirating ships on the open water? Never thought I'd see the day...","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_60reward_0_body_0":"Well, if you wanna go the obvious route. Can we borrow Karin?","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This doesn't appear to be all that was taken, but I thank you for your quick and decisive action, Lieutenant.","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Heh, that's what we're here for, right?","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Wait, no it isn't.","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_70enddialog_1_body_2":"And what's the deal with these Reef Bandits? I thought we were cool now?","mis_n02_rbcargo_010_cargo_70enddialog_2_body_0":"That's not something I can answer, Lieutenant. Perhaps the Chief would be of more help?","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright Chief, what gives? What's with all the high-seas piracy?","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Boda bun ten. Ela monot du fan fan. Fan della muny.","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_10startdialog_2_body_0":"The Chief is saying that he's not the boss of all the Reef Bandits, but he says there may be another group with more cargo ships near here.","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_20hint_0_body_0":"I guess \"Chief\" is more of an honorary title?","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_60reward_0_body_0":"All this for tea? I should've thrown this junk in the harbor.","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This better be the rest of your stuff that was stolen, Pike. Oh, and you can have Karin back now.","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_70enddialog_1_body_0":"It appears the rest of our stolen supplies are here and unbroken, for the most part.","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_70enddialog_2_body_0":"What was so important that we had to go rushing out to secure this stuff anyway?","mis_n02_rbcargo_020_pirates_70enddialog_3_body_0":"We've been out of tea for days now! We couldn't go on any longer without it!","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ramsey and Perkins are not very convincing Reef Bandits, Morgan. Maybe it's Perkins' fiery red hair, or that Ramsey is a full head taller than any of the others.","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, it's not like we're going to be doing a lot of talking with the Sovereign Navy. As long as Pike's old murder buddies show up, it's good enough.","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_20hint_0_body_0":"Finally, time for some payback.","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_60reward_0_body_0":"Lieutenant! I see one! He's trying to swim away!","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wow, sir! I was worried for a minute there but we pulled it off!","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_70enddialog_1_body_1":"My plan worked perfectly! Hold your applause, everyone. Form a single file line so you can each praise me individually.","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_70enddialog_1_title_0":"HA!","mis_n02_rbdef_010_sink_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We should scour the debris for surviving Sovereign. We might be able to get some valuable intel if we can find one of them alive.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Name, rank, and serial number. That's all I've gotten from him so far. You're welcome to try, Morgan, but this guy's been trained pretty well.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Spill it, you piece of slime. What's your beef with the Reef Bandits? Why are you and your cronies determined to wipe them out?","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Morgan, right? Whispers of you have made it back to the Sovereign Nation. We know what you're capable of. You can't scare me. Didn't that deserter, Pike, tell you what he was doing? We're just here to finish his job.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Is that so? Huh. Ramsey, wrap this guy up and stow him on one of our transport ships. I want to get this guy down to Pike but I don't want him on one of our warships.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_20hint_0_body_0":"I'll take care of it.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_60reward_0_body_0":"This thing sounds important. Let's head back to the Outpost.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You found one alive? That's quite surprising considering the training they're put through.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Can it, Pike. We know there's more to this whole story that you haven't told us about. Now would be a great time to come clean. What were you REALLY doing out here?","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You have to understand, Morgan. I was a different man back then. I couldn't possibly fathom the consequences of my actions at the time. I was simply following orders, but that's no excuse.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Spill it, Pike. Quit stalling.","mis_n02_rbdef_020_pow_70enddialog_4_body_0":"We were tasked with finding something that the Reef Bandits were protecting. The details of which were never clear, but it's something very powerful. We were to find it at all costs, regardless of what happened to the Bandits.","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, sir? We found some sort of notes on the Sovereign prisoner. It looks like it's coded though. I can't make it out.","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Let me see that. Hmm, yep. It's definitely written in code.","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Zoey? You're looking at this thing pretty intensely. Do you have some insight?","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It looks like somethin' my grampa taught me about when I was young. I loved figurin' out stuff like this. I reckon I could build a device to make sense of it.","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_20hint_0_body_0":"Wait, is this why your handwriting is so bad?","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_60reward_0_body_0":"I have Captain Pike on the radio, sir.","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All done, LT! It weren't too difficult neither. Looks like their next targets are\u00a0listed here. They're gonna be attackin' these two places at the same time!","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Brilliant Zoey! We're finally a step ahead of these guys.","mis_n02_rbdef_030_code_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Perkins! Radio Pike and let him know what we found out. This is going to take some coordination.","mis_n02_rbdef_040_part1_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright men. While we protect one group, Pike and his ships are going to protect the other group. I shouldn't have to tell you how important this is.","mis_n02_rbdef_040_part1_10startdialog_0_body_1":"The Reef Bandits had their homes destroyed, all because of some stupid thing the Sovereign thinks they have. But, we're going to put an end to this careless slaughter. Today we say, \"Not this time.\"","mis_n02_rbdef_040_part1_20hint_0_body_0":"*sniff* Lead the way, sir!","mis_n02_rbdef_040_part1_60reward_0_body_0":"What's luck got to do with it?","mis_n02_rbdef_040_part1_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We've beaten them, Lieutenant. They put up quite a fight but we won.","mis_n02_rbdef_040_part1_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Let's hope Pike has similar luck.","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We know what we must do. Lieutenant Morgan was generous enough to lend us some of his fleet to protect the Reef Bandits. Let's put these ships to good use.","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Captain Pike, sir? Are you ever going to tell the Imperials the rest of the story? I think they deserve to know.","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'll have to before too long. Let's just try to survive this first.","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_20hint_0_body_0":"Stay safe, Perkins...","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_60reward_0_body_0":"That's a very poignant outlook.","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_70enddialog_0_body_0":"They've all been destroyed. Why does it seem I'm constantly pursued by death and violence? Why can't I just be left in peace?","mis_n02_rbdef_050_part2_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You know that's not how the world works, Captain. The day you stop fighting is the day you stop living.","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright, so the Sovereign have been defeated. Let's bring this boat back home for some celebratory drinks.","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, enemy patrol groups were cleared out sir, but I can see what looks like a makeshift base on the island. Should we go in for a closer look?","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_10startdialog_2_body_0":"A makeshift base? We better go in for a closer look. There could be valuable intel in that place.","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_20hint_0_body_0":"Perkins! Put those binoculars away! It's impolite to stare.","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_60reward_0_body_0":"Staging area? I don't like the sound of that.","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Anyone find anything yet?","mis_n02_rbdef_055_closer_70enddialog_1_body_0":"No sir. There doesn't appear to be anything of value here. This must have been a staging area for something else.","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Oh dear\u2026 Lieutenant Morgan, sir? The uh, the Chief here is saying it's all for naught. The simultaneous attacks were a distraction while the Sovereign sent another fleet to a third location.","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_10startdialog_1_body_1":"We were supposed to decipher that piece of paper, weren't we? Then we would be out of the way while they went after what they really wanted. Where the hell is Pike?","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Wait? It was a trick?!","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm here, Lieutenant.","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_10startdialog_3_body_0":"What the hell is this all about? I want the WHOLE truth. Why are all these people dying? What were they protecting?","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_20hint_0_body_0":"We need to get to Reef Bandit Camp. I'll explain there.","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_60reward_0_body_0":"OK, now I'm a little worried.","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The Reef Bandits know the location of an immense power which they've been guarding for many, many years. With the Sovereign in control of it, I'm sorry to say, we are lost. There's nothing we can do.","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Wait a second, you're going to have to be a little more specific than just \"immense power\". What does that even mean?","mis_n02_rbdef_060_switch_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It means the end of us, Morgan.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Message from Captain Pike, sir.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Give that to me, Perkins.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Hmm, he wants to see us. Well, me specifically, but I like to travel in groups so you're coming too.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yes sir.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_20hint_0_body_0":"Look less enthusiastic, Perkins.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_60reward_0_body_0":"Alright, but is this going to take long?","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright, Pike. We're here. What was so important that I had to rush down here before finishing my macrame project?","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We're more alike than you may realize, Lieutenant. I've committed some truly horrible acts in my lifetime, but the time has come to start making amends. With your help, we can still set things right.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Kinda heavy there, Pike. I usually don't become that introspective until after a drink or two.","mis_n02_rbhome_010_pike_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Fine, I'll get to the point. We need to find the Reef Bandits a home. As a former Sovereign, I feel responsible for their plight. The Sovereign drove them from their land and burned their homes. I need to help them. I must.","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins? Why are we out in the middle of the ocean?","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This is one of the possible spots Pike mentioned for the Reef Bandits' new home. There's a chance this island is already inhabited, but we won't know for sure until we get there.","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm sure it'll be that easy.","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_60reward_0_body_0":"Thanks for shooting at us!","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Oh look, Reef Bandits \u2026 and they don't look friendly.","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_70enddialog_1_body_0":"But sir! We had to fight a bunch of angry Reef Bandits! We barely escaped with our hulls intact!","mis_n02_rbhome_020_numberone_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It was just a friendly skirmish. We should thank 'em for keeping us on our toes.","mis_n02_rbhome_025_numberone_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins? Why are we out in the middle of the ocean?","mis_n02_rbhome_025_numberone_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This is one of the possible spots Pike mentioned for the Reef Bandits' new home.

We had to fight a bunch of angry Reef Bandits! We barely escaped with our hulls intact!","mis_n02_rbhome_025_numberone_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It was just a friendly skirmish. We should thank 'em for keeping us on our toes.","mis_n02_rbhome_030_numbertwo_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We should be arriving at those coordinates soon, Pike. You say you surveyed this island before?","mis_n02_rbhome_030_numbertwo_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Not surveyed, no. My men briefly glanced at it the last time they went this way. It was empty then.","mis_n02_rbhome_030_numbertwo_10startdialog_2_body_0":"When was that, exactly?","mis_n02_rbhome_030_numbertwo_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Roughly two years ago, perhaps a bit longer.","mis_n02_rbhome_030_numbertwo_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh great.","mis_n02_rbhome_030_numbertwo_70enddialog_0_body_0":"\u2026 The familiar shape of Sovereign ships on the horizon.","mis_n02_rbhome_035_numbertwo_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We should be arriving at those coordinates soon, Pike.

Apologies.","mis_n02_rbhome_035_numbertwo_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, that's an understatement. Let's go to the next location.","mis_n02_rbhome_040_numberthree_10startdialog_0_body_0":"This next island better be some sort of Reef Bandit paradise. All this sailing is getting old. I don't care if it turns out to be inhabited already. That can be fixed with guns, if necessary.","mis_n02_rbhome_040_numberthree_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Now, remember Lieutenant, we're trying to find a home for a group of displaced people. It would be in our best interest to not create another.","mis_n02_rbhome_040_numberthree_20hint_0_body_0":"Well, if someone else is already living there they better like to share.","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We've reached the island, sirs!","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_10startdialog_1_body_0":"It looks large enough from here. We should go ashore for a closer look.","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_20hint_0_body_0":"Hmm, the inhabitants look a little hungry\u2026","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_60reward_0_body_0":"Have you ever tried Raptor Nuggets? Delicious.","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Maybe this island is a bit too dangerous.","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Nonsense! There are just a few\u2026 dozen raptors, here and there. Nothing the Reef Bandits can't handle.","mis_n02_rbhome_045_numberthree_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Besides, they'll have something other than fish to eat.","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_10startdialog_0_body_0":"If we expect the Reef Bandits to survive on this island you found, they're going to need some basic construction supplies to build up their infrastructure. I've put together a list for you to review.","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_10startdialog_1_body_0":"This all seems reasonable. I assume you can handle this, Floyd?","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I anticipate no problems gathering these materials. Every once in a while at this blasted Outpost I get the opportunity to utilize the skills I brought with me for their actual purpose.","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_20hint_0_body_0":"Yeah, like building roads and hospitals is more important than instruments of war...","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_60reward_0_body_0":"I mean, really. That's exactly what we're trying to do.","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_70enddialog_0_body_0":"With these materials, the Reef Bandits should be well on their way to reclaiming some small part of what was so savagely stripped from them by the Sovereign Navy.","mis_n02_rbhome_050_supplies_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, that's the idea, Floyd.","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey, Perkins!

I put together a short list of things, mainly stuff I know I would want in their situation.","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_10startdialog_1_body_0":"But sir, this just says \"RUM\" in capital letters.","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I know it's a short list, but I think we can make it work. Feel free to add to it if you think of anything else, like ice cube trays or tiny umbrellas.","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_20hint_0_body_0":"*sigh* Yes sir.","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_60reward_0_body_0":"Daiquiris, Mojitos, Dark and Stormys...","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Um, Floyd?

I need to top off my drink.","mis_n02_rbhome_060_moresupplies_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Perkins showed me your \"list.\" I threw it out and set him about gathering things they may ACTUALLY need.

Rum has all sorts of applications!","mis_n02_rbhome_070_raptorisland_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright men! Listen up! Our task is to remove the remaining raptors or any other deadly animals we find on the island.

This sounds pretty dangerous.","mis_n02_rbhome_070_raptorisland_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Look, Stevens, is it? The only danger we'll be facing is from six-foot-tall killing machines with razor sharp claws. Oh, and razor sharp teeth.

Well done, men.","mis_n02_rbhome_080_attack_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir? I have some bad news.

I'm asking you a question.","mis_n02_rbhome_080_attack_60reward_0_body_0":"We should start taxing these people...","mis_n02_rbhome_080_attack_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Damage report?","mis_n02_rbhome_080_attack_70enddialog_1_body_0":"No major casualties, Lieutenant.

It doesn't look like anything caught fire while I was asleep, either. And now I see Captain Pike approaching. Great. I wonder what catastrophe he needs help avoiding this time.","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan! My men and I wanted to thank you for your recent generosity, so we brought you all some Boxes Day gifts. We hope you enjoy them!","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh wow, is that it? No life threatening problems, or hostile factions after you?","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well, there was one other thing. It's a Boxes Day tradition to celebrate the times with copious amounts of food and alcohol!","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_20hint_0_body_0":"Boxes Day sounds amazing!","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_60reward_0_body_0":"Happy Holidays, Outpost!","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_70enddialog_0_body_0":"OK, I've officially had too much to eat. Someone... who am I kidding, Perkins, get a wheelbarrow and roll me out of here. I'm too full to move.","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes sir, I just need to digest for a minute\u2026","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Your cabin boy appears to have dozed off, Lieutenant. Would you like me to top off your glass?","mis_p01_coldnavy_040_feast_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Don't have to ask me twice! For once, I can say that I'm glad you stopped by!","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ah, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood...","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Storm clouds worry the sun's yearnings.","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Aaagh! Wh-what the...?! How did you get into...?","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Shadows slip underfoot, unbidden, untamed. Would you hold the night?","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Lady, I have no idea what you're saying. And if you think I...","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Uh, Morgan? Who're you talking to?","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_10startdialog_6_body_0":"I'm talking to... Hey, where'd she go? And where'd those Raiders come from? \u2026 Wait, Raiders?! Sound the alarm!","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_20hint_0_body_0":"How do these guys stab tanks, anyway?","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_60reward_0_body_0":"I'll show them\u2026 I'll show them all!","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_70enddialog_0_body_0":"SHE let them in! I know she did!","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Uh, Zoey, who's Morgan talking about?","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I don't know... Maybe it's some kind of heat hallucination thing...?","mis_p01_crazy_010_attackraiders_70enddialog_3_body_0":"No! This isn't like that time with the purple mammoths! I *saw* her! She was *here*!","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Look, Morgan, I'm not saying I don't believe you...","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_10startdialog_1_body_0":"She was here! She spoke like a fortune cookie! I *talked* to her!  How else do you think those Raiders got in to attack us?","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We've searched all over the outpost, but found no sign of her. I'm forced to conclude that you simply imagined the whole\u2014","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Those with their heads in the clouds cannot see their feet.","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Yikes!","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Holy...! How did she get past...?  Hey! She's getting away! After her!!","mis_p01_crazy_020_visitcrazy_20hint_0_body_0":"It's rude to say I told you so, but I did. And am.","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sheesh! This place is well-hidden! I don't think we ever would've suspected it was here if we weren't following her!","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That's what's bothering me. She slipped into our outpost so easily.  Couldn't she have evaded us just as easily?  Unless...","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It's a trap.  And we just fell into it.  Again.  Swell.","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_20hint_0_body_0":"We should really start looking before we leap...","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_60reward_0_body_0":"Raider Chick, wherever you are, we'll be back!","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wait, this can't be all of them! Where are the others?  Where'd the crazy Raider chick go?","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_70enddialog_1_body_0":"If I had to guess, I'd say they're hiding.  They seem to be good at that.","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Damn! We need another approach!  Back to the outpost!  We'll ask Taos if he knows what's going on.","mis_p01_crazy_021_attackraiders_enc_name":"Raider Ambush!","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_0_body_0":"How to detect the path of Blades in Moonlight? That will be... difficult at best. No human can hope to match her stealth. That is why she is one of Gantas' lieutenants.","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_1_body_0":"There's GOT to be a way. It's not like she's invisible. We just have no idea where she is or where she goes.","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, Floyd and I have been talking...","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_3_body_0":"On second thought, I think I like being alive better...","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Wait, hear us out! We believe that the key to their stealth is shadow. Even at the sun's zenith, there are always *some* shadows cast.  It seems Blades in Moonlight can hide even in the smallest spot of shadow.","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_5_body_0":"We think our best chance is to just get rid of the shadows!  If we created a series of mirrors and set them up around her outpost, we could reflect light all over the place! Poof! No more dark!","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_10startdialog_6_body_0":"That sounds... non-lethal.  Do it!","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_20hint_0_body_0":"Make 'em shiny enough to see in!","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_60reward_0_body_0":"This IS a nice mirror... And I need a haircut.","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perfect! I've already mapped out the four focal points around Blades in Moonlight's camp. Once we get them in place, there will be nowhere for her to hide!","mis_p01_crazy_030_makemirrors_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Will the mirrors also interpret what she's saying? Then it'd be perfect.","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Looks like those mirrors are working! I can actually see people in Blades' outpost now!","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_10startdialog_1_body_0":"By the way, Ramsey, who was right about a \"nonexistent\" Raider woman sneaking into our outpost?","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_10startdialog_2_body_0":"*sigh* You. So please don't do your \"I Told You So\" speech again.","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_10startdialog_3_body_0":"But everyone loves the \"I Told You So\" speech!  Oh, don't be so grumpy, Ramsey. At least now Ms. Crazy Blades can't sneak up on us again...","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_10startdialog_4_body_0":"The mighty oak falls at the jaws of the humble termite.","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Arrrgh! Not again!  That's it, sister, you're going DOWN!","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_20hint_0_body_0":"All those knives make me nervous.","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_60reward_0_body_0":"Let's get back while there's something to save.","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_70enddialog_0_body_0":"That was easier than I thought it'd be.","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Too easy.  Especially since she escaped us so quickly.  It was almost like she was...","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Sirs! You have to come back to the outpost right away! The Raiders just set it on fire!","mis_p01_crazy_040_attackcrazy_70enddialog_3_body_0":"\u2026 a distraction.","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Whew! Th-the fire's finally out, sir!","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Barely adequate work, Perkins. The rest of you: how exactly did this happen?","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It was just like last time! They just snuck in right past our defenses!","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's it, I've had it! If Crazy Blades wants to play this game, we'll play it! We'll make this place so unfriendly that no one will be able to step foot in it without getting it hacked off!","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_20hint_0_body_0":"I don't want an ant to pass through without getting shot!","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_60reward_0_body_0":"I kinda like it this way...","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ah, sir... One of the turrets almost pumped me full of lead...","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Good, good! That means the new defenses are working! Let's see Crazy Blades sabotage us NOW!","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_70enddialog_2_body_0":"But we can't work under these conditions!","mis_p01_crazy_050_builddefense_70enddialog_3_body_0":"But Crazy Blades will be stymied!  That's the important part!","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Y'know, maybe Crazy Blades has the right idea.  We need to strike at her outpost the way she's struck at ours.","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Huh, that's a good plan.  I guess hatred really does bring out the best in some people...","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'll ignore the implications of that for now.  The question is, how do we hurt her the most?","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, as you pointed out, they use a lot of knives, and it looks like this group makes their own.  They use a lot of fuel to run their metalworks.  If we cut off that fuel supply, we can put a big hurt on their weapon supply too.","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_20hint_0_body_0":"Why do they need so many new knives?","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_60reward_0_body_0":"Take your koans and shove it!","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The kitten hisses at the mammoth, demanding passage.","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Hah! You're frustrated, aren't you! In your FACE, Crazy Blades!","mis_p01_crazy_060_attackoil_70enddialog_2_body_0":"That's our Morgan for you: always gracious in victory.","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_10startdialog_0_body_0":"This is it, men! We're about to fight another of Gantas' lieutenants!","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Hopefully the last!","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Fists flex to crush the boulder. The boulder cares not.","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Morgan raises his pistol, takes down annoying Raider woman!","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_20hint_0_body_0":"The sunning lizard listens not to the poet.","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_60reward_0_body_0":"I hope Gantas gets the message.","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Even the thirsty boar cannot swallow the lake.","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I have no idea what you just said, and I don't care. You've lost! Get out, and never come back!","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_70enddialog_2_body_0":"When the sun rises, does the day last forever?","mis_p01_crazy_070_defeatcrazy_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Okay, I think I got that one... And I wish I didn't.","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_10startdialog_0_body_0":"HELP!!!","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'll be in my tent.","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No, please! Warlord Gantas' men are after us! Help!","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wait, so you led them here? Wonderful.","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_20hint_0_body_0":"Please hurry!","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_60reward_0_body_0":"I was hoping I wouldn't ever have to see this place again.","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Since when do you guys fight each other?","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You took Warlord Gantas' totem and then some people started saying that he couldn't protect the holy site and he should step down and now a bunch of the grown-ups are fighting! Help us, please!","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wait... totem? Holy site? Are you saying that place we attacked wasn't your village?","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_70enddialog_3_body_0":"No - that's our Sanctuary. Only a few of us live there, and now Gantas and his warriors are attacking!","mis_p01_cvlwr_010_helpraiderkids_enc1_name":"Raiders v Raider Kids","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Elder Taos! We brought help!","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Help? You bring the source of chaos itself!","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You dare impugn the actions of the Empire? No, you know what, that's fair.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Your actions have caused great upheaval. Warlord Gantas has long been a cruel tyrant. When you took his totem, it was the first sign of weakness any of us had seen. There were murmurs of dissent, but Gantas responded with greater cruelty.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You know, Lieutenant, it sounds like this whole situation is a box of powder just about to blow.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_10startdialog_5_body_0":"And I feel an awful lot like a spark.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_20hint_0_body_0":"Sounds like these Raiders might just take care of each other for us...","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_60reward_0_body_0":"A civil war might be kind of a nice change of pace from the Rebellion we've been fighting for the last 10 years.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You have joined together now - this was wise. But you will die alone, broken against the walls of my fortress. BWAHAHA!","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_1_body_0":"So, you have chosen a path for all of us.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_2_body_0":"What do you mean? Aren't you guys going to rise up and crush your oppressor?","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_3_body_0":"You have created uncertainty in the people. Some will abandon Warlord Gantas, but not all. Until you crush him, utterly, many raiders will call him leader.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Sounds like we're just getting started, sir.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_5_body_0":"We can lead you back to his base if you want. It's not far from here but would be hidden to someone who didn't know where to look.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_6_body_0":"I recommend a scout mission, sir. We can get an idea of what we're up against.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_70enddialog_7_body_0":"Hmm. Sure - why not? Another opportunity for us to get our money's worth out of that Recon Vehicle.","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_enc1_name":"Gantas' Raiders","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_enc2_name":"Village Raiders","mis_p01_cvlwr_020_defendraiders_enc3_name":"Village Raiders","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I demand to face him!","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Where is the one called Morgan?","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You mean Lieutenant Morgan? That's him there!","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Morgan?","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Remind me to come up with some ways to punish you. Actually, you come up with them, and get me a list.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_2_title_0":"What the hell, Perkins?","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_3_title_0":"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I have asked the most beautiful woman in my tribe to join her life to mine. But Yenkcha has said that ever since you came to her defense at Elder Taos' Sanctuary Village, her path is yours.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_4_title_0":"Enough talk!","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Also, seriously, Yenkcha? That name is terrible.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_5_title_0":"I have no idea what you're talking about.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_6_body_0":"My honor must be satisfied!","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_10startdialog_6_title_0":"How dare you!","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_20hint_0_body_0":"Maybe if I shoot him a few times, he'll go away.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_60reward_0_body_0":"What kind of name is Yenkcha?","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You fight well, Morgan. I see why Yenkcha has chosen you. Know this: I will not be the last to challenge you for her hand.","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_70enddialog_0_title_0":"I yield!","mis_p01_duels_010_duelraider_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, that's just SUPER.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I demand to face the Skinny Beast!","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_0_title_0":"I have come for Morgan!","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Is that what you guys are calling me?","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Skinny Beast?","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_2_title_0":"So you are Morgan!","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_3_title_0":"No! Wait... crap. Yeah.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_4_body_0":"My Chosen is Yenkcha, the great beauty and-","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_4_title_0":"I am on a mission of love!","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Look, I don't know who she is, but if you need me to shoot you or whatever, let's get it over with.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_10startdialog_5_title_0":"Oh, this again. Right.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_20hint_0_body_0":"This should be over quick.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_20hint_0_title_0":"This should be over quick.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_60reward_0_body_0":"Yenkcha. It sounds like someone holding in a sneeze.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So, Yenkcha's beloved Morgan has fought for her hand again.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Well met!","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I fought for peace and quiet.","mis_p01_duels_020_duelcannoneer_70enddialog_1_title_0":"What? No, I didn't.","mis_p01_duels_030_duelboomboom_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Bring me the Morgan!","mis_p01_duels_030_duelboomboom_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Oh man, again?","mis_p01_duels_030_duelboomboom_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You know why I have come?","mis_p01_duels_030_duelboomboom_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Skinny Beast!","mis_p01_duels_030_duelboomboom_10startdialog_3_body_0":"and you think I care for some reason.

And how do you get these Victory Points?","mis_p01_pvp_010_finishrandompvp_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, by engaging in live fire exercises with other outposts.","mis_p01_pvp_010_finishrandompvp_10startdialog_4_body_0":"\u2026 You're joking.","mis_p01_pvp_010_finishrandompvp_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Nope.

Now where are those troops I wanted trained...?","mis_p01_pvp_030_earntier1pvp_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Er... They're still at the Barracks.  You wanted us to drop everything for the live fire exercises, remember?","mis_p01_pvp_030_earntier1pvp_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh.  Right.  I did say that, didn't I?  Oh, well, then, I know whose fault this is.","mis_p01_raidpal_010_skins_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We're having problems covering our local patrols, Morgan. With everything that's happening, our troops are being stretched to the limit.","mis_p01_raidpal_010_skins_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We need support and backup. Right now, the best option available is probably Taos' Raiders.","mis_p01_raidpal_010_skins_10startdialog_2_body_0":"But... Between attacking their kin, starting a civil war, and everything else that's happened, I think most of Taos' people still hate us.  Well, you.","mis_p01_raidpal_010_skins_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Even after all we've done for them? Well, Taos at least seems to like us. Maybe I can have a talk with him.","mis_p01_raidpal_010_skins_20hint_0_body_0":"How can anyone not love the Empire?","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_10startdialog_0_body_0":"To what do we owe the... honor of this visit, Imperials?","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Look, Taos, we're not going to survive very well if we don't work together, right? But I get the feeling that a lot of your people still don't particularly like us.","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You are seen as outsiders, weeds choking the garden. Even your actions against Gantas\u2014vile as he is\u2014are seen by some as turning us against one another.  A few even question my judgement in allowing you to live.","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wow, that's kinda harsh. Either way, we need all the allies we can get in these parts. Maybe a little gift will help smooth things over?","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_20hint_0_body_0":"Perkins! I have a job for you! Get an apron!","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_60reward_0_body_0":"I mean, how badass would that be? I'd be, like, rawr!","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What... are these?","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Raptor skins! Don't worry, they aren't infected with any exotic diseases, unless you count Perkins's cold...","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We have plenty of Raptor hides, trophies of our daily hunts. My people would not be impressed. It is likely they would take it as an insult, to be given skins from tamed raptors such as yours.","mis_p01_raidpal_011_skins_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh. Okay.  Um... We'll just be taking these home, then... Maybe Perkins can make me a tuxedo out of these hides.","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Do not mistake me - I hope you succeed. Were you to prove yourselves honorable to my people, I will have gained an ally, and my leadership would no longer be in doubt.","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, do you have any ideas, Taos? I'm new to this whole \"respecting other cultures\" thing. I'm more used to grinding them under the Empire's boot and all.","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_10startdialog_2_body_0":"My people are as the lone pine, weather beaten, but resolute. We prefer not to put our problems onto others. But actions will shout, while mere words whisper.","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Actions, huh? Well, we did pretty well the last time we had to defend this place.  Maybe we could do it again...","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, my, a mammoth invasion! Wherever did it come from?","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_60reward_0_body_0":"Damn. Back to the old drawing board...","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Phew! It sure was lucky we were here to drive away all those mammoths!","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Indeed. Though I find it strange that you smell of desert herbs known to attract mammoths...","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, I... Uh...","mis_p01_raidpal_020_fightmammoths_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I am patient, but my people will not be so forgiving. Perhaps you should attempt to solve a problem that you yourself did not create.","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Elder Taos! Elder Taos! Look who's here!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_10startdialog_1_title_0":"I have come for you all!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_10startdialog_2_body_0":"But...!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Warlord Gantas?!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Stand aside, everyone! I'll deal with him once and for all!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Fool! I'll crush you in front of all my fellow Raiders, and show you just how weak and pitiful the Empire is!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_20hint_0_body_0":"I'll teach you to leave these good people alone!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm gonna have to stop underestimating these people...","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, Taos, I think that will help with your problems...","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_0_title_0":"And don't come back!","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Indeed. Your show has raised many spirits here. I haven't heard my people laugh so hard in a long time.","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Right! And... Wait... Show? Laugh?","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Your slave boy Perkins made a fine Gantas, but he needs to control the cracking of his voice. Your performance was... adequate, but I admire how it actually appeared as though you were attacking your slave boy.","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Right... Appeared.","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_5_body_0":"We were all greatly entertained. My people have not been turned to your cause, but they are appreciative that you did not try another rat-brained scheme to convince us of your intentions.","mis_p01_raidpal_030_gantasduel_70enddialog_6_body_0":"I... think I need to go now.","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, I'm tired of fooling around.  Nothing we've tried has worked and Taos still won't tell me what the Raiders actually need. So I'm asking you kids.  What's gotten the adults worried?","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well... our parents are always talking about water...","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Why? You guys live right next to a lake.","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_10startdialog_3_body_0":"But we need to grow more food for all the new people chased out by Gantas but there's not enough water to drink and give to the animals and give to all the farmers and the lake used to go up to our necks but now it only goes up to our waists and...","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Okay, I get the message. But if we're going to do anything about it, we'll need the right tools...","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_20hint_0_body_0":"Now I have to put in actual effort...","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_60reward_0_body_0":"Waltz with me, Morgan! Waltz with me!","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_70enddialog_0_body_0":"And what's all this for?","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, since being sneaky and underhanded hasn't gotten us anywhere this time, I've decided to try something crazy: actual benevolence! We're going to solve the Sanctuary's water problems!","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_70enddialog_2_body_0":"A civic works project?! Finally, an opportunity to actually do what I was sent here to do! No weapons of mass destruction or dodging bullets! Oh, beautiful, beautiful day!!","mis_p01_raidpal_040_makestuff_70enddialog_3_body_0":"\u2026 Great, the smartest guy in the outpost's gone insane. Ah, well, at least he's in good company.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So you want an aqueduct to connect the lake in the Raider Sanctuary to the larger one nearby?","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Right.  That way the Sanctuary can have the water they need without having to go through the hostile and dangerous Raptor Nest.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's... actually an excellent plan. But you realize that if we're going to build that aqueduct, WE'LL have to go through the hostile and dangerous Raptor Nest.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Already got that covered.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm not even surprised anymore.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_60reward_0_body_0":"It's nice to have options, you know?","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This structure will let us flourish in these lands for generations to come. I am... impressed.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_70enddialog_1_body_0":"But of course. When a military-industrial complex puts its mind to something, there's not much it can't accomplish.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You and your clan deserve great thanks for this. My people will long benefit from this work, and I believe it will shine unto you as the sun upon a calm lake.","mis_p01_raidpal_050_clearraptors_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Huh.  Respect can be *earned*. I'll have to remember this for future reference.","mis_p01_raptr_010_getraptor1_10startdialog_0_body_0":"just outside the base. Naturally, I disciplined him for lying.

That giant tin can?","mis_p01_ruins_012_ancientconstruct_2_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Indeed you did. Unfortunately, that was simply part of the automated sanitation system.

He's getting a constant stream from other Raider suppliers!","mis_p01_sarin_060_attackweapons_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Hm. If Sarin gets that many weapons, he could outlast us. We have to stop him before he becomes too entrenched to get him out again.","mis_p01_sarin_060_attackweapons_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I agree, but something about this doesn't feel right.","mis_p01_sarin_060_attackweapons_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Other than our enemy getting a huge advantage over us?

So they did... This doesn't look good...","mis_p01_sarin_060_attackweapons_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Morgan, you have to escape!  I'll cover you while you...","mis_p01_sarin_060_attackweapons_70enddialog_4_body_0":"There will be no cowardly flight today!

Is it true?!","mis_p01_sarin_070_attackprison_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm afraid so. Ramsey and Morgan have been captured by Sarin.

We're gonna rescue 'em, right?","mis_p01_sarin_070_attackprison_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Of course we are!

Ramsey!","mis_p01_sarin_070_attackprison_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Captain! Zoey! What are you doing here? This could be a trap!","mis_p01_sarin_070_attackprison_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Speak for yourself! I'm glad they're here!","mis_p01_sarin_070_attackprison_70enddialog_3_body_0":"We'd better get out of here now, sirs, before Sarin comes back!","mis_p01_sarin_080_defeatsarin_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Phew!  Am I glad to be out of there! Having Ramsey as my only company was getting kinda tedious.","mis_p01_sarin_080_defeatsarin_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Sarin isn't gonna take this lying down.  Our rescue makes him look bad.  He's going to want revenge.","mis_p01_sarin_080_defeatsarin_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Then we take the initiative.  We regroup right here, right now.  We counterattack before he can prepare - teach him what happens when he takes Imperial citizens hostage!","mis_p01_sarin_080_defeatsarin_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Agreed.  Men, move out!  We'll hit him hard and fast!","mis_p01_sarin_080_defeatsarin_20hint_0_body_0":"Sarin will pay for feeding us boiled boar!","mis_p01_sarin_080_defeatsarin_60reward_0_body_0":"Perkins?

Shouldn't I still be in my uniform?","mis_p01_sauna_010_idea_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Nonsense! It's a \"natural sauna\" Perkins, and you know the rules. Appropriate attire for every situation. Rule #137 of the Imperial Handbook.","mis_p01_sauna_020_caves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Wow, these caves are a lot warmer than I remember them being. Hurry up, Perkins!

And If I give you mine then what am I going to wear?","mis_p01_sauna_020_caves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Just put your uniform back on and take a few demerits.

These caves are officially too hot.

Any idea what happened or how they could have made it this far?","mis_p01_sauna_040_spiderwasps_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I was curious myself, so I took a look at the bathrobes and slippers you brought back with you. They seem to be covered in the remains of spiderwasps that, I assume, you dispatched in the caves.","mis_p01_sauna_040_spiderwasps_70enddialog_1_body_1":"It seems the viscera of the spiderwasp acts as a pheromone attractor for other spiderwasps, signalling them that there is danger.

They barely even looked at the card!","mis_p01_vday_030_rands_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, I'm pretty sure they thought we were trying to steal their mail.","mis_p01_vday_040_end_60reward_0_body_0":"Floyd, get the eye-bleach. We're in need of a Level 4 cleansing.","mis_p01_vday_040_end_70enddialog_0_body_0":"OK, so that didn't work out quite the way I wanted it to, but I think we got our message across.","mis_p01_vday_040_end_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Greetings Imperials. It's time once again for \u2014","mis_p01_vday_040_end_70enddialog_2_body_0":"NO! No, no, no. You get out of here, right now! We want nothing to do with you\u2026","mis_p01_vfact_010_toolsforraiderkids_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey, Captain! Our little Raider friends offered to help. I already inducted them as honorary Imperial Wee Cadets!","mis_p01_vfact_010_toolsforraiderkids_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Wow. You have the coolest Tool Shop ever, Zoey!","mis_p01_vfact_010_toolsforraiderkids_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I know, right? So to get these guys trained up, I'm gonna need some tools for each of them. Help me out, will ya?","mis_p01_vfact_010_toolsforraiderkids_20hint_0_body_0":"I certainly wouldn't argue if you wanted to build me a second or third Tool Shop to get this done quicker!","mis_p01_vfact_010_toolsforraiderkids_60reward_0_body_0":"Now that I have my own team of Tool Kids, the Raiders won't be able to count all our vehicles! Wait - never mind, Morgan told me Raiders can't count anyway.","mis_p01_vfact_020_buildvehiclefactory_10startdialog_0_body_0":"With the kids' help, we can get a real assembly line going! Let's get rollin' on this Vehicle Factory!","mis_p01_vfact_020_buildvehiclefactory_20hint_0_body_0":"This is gonna be so much fun! Find the Vehicle Factory in the Build Menu!","mis_p01_vfact_020_buildvehiclefactory_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm so excited! My very own Vehicle Factory! I wonder what I should work on first...","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Well, I figure it won't be long before y'all start smashin' the heck outta these vehicles.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, I mean, it's not like I'm going to go out of my way to smash them, but, yeah, probably there'll be a lot of smashing.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_10startdialog_2_body_0":"All our damaged vehicles will get fixed up there.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_10startdialog_2_title_0":"We best build a Repair Bay then.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_20hint_0_body_0":"Imagine if we tried fixin' 'em at the hospital. Nuts!","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_60reward_0_body_0":"My stance is \"against.\"","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Was it Floyd? I bet it was Floyd. That guy is always building stuff all over the place like it's so cool to build things.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Who authorized the construction of this repair bay?","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I figured we needed it so we could keep our vehicles runnin' and such.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Er, it was me, LT.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Just\u2026 don't build anything else with robots without asking. You know my stance on robots, Zoey. I've been very clear on this.","mis_p01_vfact_025_buildrepairbay_70enddialog_2_title_0":"I guess it's fine.","mis_p01_vfact_030_buildfield_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey, Floyd, these vehicles I'm buildin' ain't gonna run on enthusiasm alone...","mis_p01_vfact_030_buildfield_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You're right - we need fuel! We're a little short on Oil right now. Lucky for us, basic vehicles can run on a fuel derived from plants we grow right here on base! Well, their byproducts anyway...","mis_p01_vfact_030_buildfield_20hint_0_body_0":"We'll need some raw materials first.","mis_p01_vfact_030_buildfield_60reward_0_body_0":"Great - now I'll just convert these plants to a fluid we can use in the fuel tanks!","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins, Floyd asked us to, uh, PROCESS, these plants into fuel at the Boar Ranch. Take a look at the plans he gave me.","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, that's not so bad, it looks like we just have to... oh.","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yeah.","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_10startdialog_3_body_0":"And then... and we squeeze that?","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Yup.","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_10startdialog_5_body_0":"So we take the... fluid... and...","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_20hint_0_body_0":"Floyd's understanding of science is terrifying.","mis_p01_vfact_040_processfieldjob_60reward_0_body_0":"Please... never make me do that again.","mis_p01_vfact_050_trainscoutbike_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Before we let 'em loose on bigger stuff, my crew needs to cut their teeth on somethin' a touch simpler. How about we start 'em with a Scout Bike?","mis_p01_vfact_050_trainscoutbike_20hint_0_body_0":"Scout Bikes are like Shock Troopers on wheels.","mis_p01_vfact_050_trainscoutbike_60reward_0_body_0":"We're gonna build a ramp in the backyard and do sweet jumps!","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant... I hate asking you for somethin', especially at a time like this, but...","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_10startdialog_1_body_0":"The Empire isn't the enemy, Sheriff, even if we do tend to blow stuff up that doesn't need blowing up.  Lay it on me.","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Life in Recoil Ridge is usually simple: we farm, we mine, we keep to ourselves. So we don't need much. But with all those Raider attacks lately, we're doing more militia training and building. Our food supplies are gettin' stretched mighty thin.","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Ah, food.  What would life be without it? Sure, Sheriff, we can probably spare some grub in exchange for future barbeque consideration.","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_20hint_0_body_0":"Life without food isn't worth living!","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_60reward_0_body_0":"You can't take the Empire out of the man.","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_70enddialog_0_body_0":"That should do it. We'll send a caravan to take it down to Recoil Ridge for you.","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Much obliged, Lieutenant. This'll help us out 'til we get back on our feet.","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Even better, each item has the official Imperial Industries brand label on them, so every time one of your citizens eats, they'll be reminded of whose generosity and raw military power brought them their sustenance!","mis_p01_wlfchase_010_makefood_70enddialog_3_body_0":"\u2026 And here I thought you might be learning what it's like to be a good frontier citizen.","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Keep alert, men! We still have a ways to go until we get to Recoil Ridge!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_10startdialog_0_body_1":"Huh\u2026 Who're these guys blocking the road? Hey! Get out of the way!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Nuh-uh. We're toll collectors, so you'd better show some respect! You owe us 1000 gold per person and 3000 gold per vehicle\u2026","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_10startdialog_2_body_0":"\"Toll collectors\"? You're those Silver Wolves goons!  And this is a public Imperial road! What kind of scam is this?","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_10startdialog_3_body_0":"*sniff* Hey, is that food? You've got a ton of it! Tell ya what: forget the gold. We'll take our toll in the form of all the food you have there... if you know what's good for you!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_20hint_0_body_0":"What's good for me is a Silver Wolf beatdown!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_60reward_0_body_0":"Those Silver Wolves don't know what they've started!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Quick, while they're busy beating up the others! Grab the food and run!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sir! They've hijacked the food trucks!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Quick! Shoot out the tires before\u2014damn! They got away!","mis_p01_wlfchase_020_hijacking_70enddialog_2_body_1":"We can't take this lying down! Back to the outpost! We'll report and regroup!","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, I want in on tracking down the Silver Wolves. They made me look like a chump, and I don't like it!","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You've got nothing to prove to any of us, Ramsey.  But I understand - and heartily approve of - your instincts for revenge.  Now we just need to figure out where they are...","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I can help with that. Some of my own people have been victims of their con, so I tracked 'em to a camp west of Recoil Ridge. I was gonna go after 'em, but then the Raiders came, and\u2026","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's all I need! Troopers, move out!","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"Hurt my body all you want. Hurt my pride - you have to pay!","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm certainly not standing in Ramsey's way, literally or otherwise.","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Sergeant Ramsey reporting, sir. The Silver Wolves have been defeated, and the food is safely in the hands of Sheriff Colt.","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Excellent work, Ramsey. It's nice to have something relatively easy to squish.  We need a break from heavily armed and hugely muscled Raiders once in a while.","mis_p01_wlfchase_040_attacksilverwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Speaking of Raiders, can we find some to shoot now? After all those Silver Wolves, I feel PUMPED!","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_10startdialog_0_body_0":"It's that time of year again, everyone! The time where we shed our selfish shells in exchange for our selfless suits!","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Floyd, that makes no sense, but it is starting to feel familiarly cold outside. Hmm, and I'm not seeing any Festivus decorations yet. That needs to change.","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Perkins! I'm feeling generous this year. Put up some Festivus decorations then invite all our neighbors here for a GIANT celebration! I want this to be epic!","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Are you sure that's wise, sir? Most of our neighbors have their own celebratory events right now.","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Yeah, well, ours is cooler so they should come join us.","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_20hint_0_body_0":"Seasons greetings, so ignore your traditions and engage in ours.","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_60reward_0_body_0":"I think we might have different definitions for \"cheer\".","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Looks pretty good, I guess. Could be shinier. Have the invites been sent? Any responses yet?","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes sir, I sent the invitations out. I got an immediate response from Sheriff Colt and another response from Elder Taos just arrived. Both are coming to the Outpost to celebrate with us. Some others too.","mis_p01_xmas3_010_celebrate_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Great! I want both of them to feel like their efforts are completely inadequate compared to an Imperial celebration! Really spread the cheer, you know?","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You invited us all the way up here and you don't even have any Winter Jubilee decorations up? I gotta say, I'm a might disappointed. I thought you wanted us to feel welcome.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Indeed, this is most discouraging. Not a single Flaming Pole tribute or Pit of Flames to acknowledge the Dawnbringer Feast.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_10startdialog_2_body_0":"This isn't panning out how I wanted it to. Perkins is the one who dishonored you guys, not me! Don't worry though, I'll force him to fix this.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_20hint_0_body_0":"I'll get right on it, sir.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_60reward_0_body_0":"Once again, I've saved the day.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_70enddialog_0_body_0":"There we go! Now everything is fixed, and we can start the celebration! Who wants egg-nog? I know I do.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_70enddialog_1_body_0":"This is much more welcoming. I am reminded of walking the battlefield after a victory, stepping over the burning corpses of my fallen enemies. It fills me with joy. I thank you for this.","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_70enddialog_2_body_0":"\u2026","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_70enddialog_2_body_1":"OK then. What about you Sheriff? Reminded of any past grotesqueries?","mis_p01_xmas3_020_together_70enddialog_3_body_0":"You've done an admirable job here lieutenant. 'Course the trees look a little puny but I can overlook that this time.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Decent enough shindig you got here, Morgan. But, some of the folks back home're wonderin' when those toys you promised for the kids are gonna arrive.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Uh...what?","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_1_body_1":"We, uh, already sent those? I think we did at least\u2026","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_1_title_1":"OH YEAH!","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's strange seein' as how they never showed up.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Yes, that is indeed strange. I bet they were stolen... by some goons... along the way.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_10startdialog_3_body_1":"We should send some more, but this time with some of our troops. For protection.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_20hint_0_body_0":"Goons. Sure.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_60reward_0_body_0":"Why not a bunch of smaller sacks?","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Hostile Raiders have been eliminated from the immediate area, Lieutenant.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Toys have been made too, LT! I even shoved 'em all into a giant sack to make 'em easier to carry.","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Just one giant sack? That seems inconvenient. Is it organized? How do you know which toys are which? You'd have to empty the whole thing\u2026","mis_p01_xmas3_030_toys_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh no, here he goes.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_10startdialog_0_body_0":"All the gifts have been loaded up, sir. The truck is ready to go whenever you give the word.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_10startdialog_1_body_0":"OK, great. Let's get this over with. I'd like to get back to the party in time to actually enjoy myself a bit. I work myself too hard sometimes.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You do seem a little more tense than usual, Lieutenant.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I don't know. I guess I'm just a little stressed? I wanted this party to go off without a hitch so I could impress our neighbors, but that obviously isn't happening.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm even less impressed than usual.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm sure the rest of this party will go just fine.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_70enddialog_0_body_0":"No more enemies in sight, Lieutenant.","mis_p01_xmas3_040_escort_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ya dun good, kid. One disaster averted.","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Anyone else noticin' things of theirs goin' missin'? I swear I brought an extra pair of gloves with me, but I ain't been able to find 'em since I got here.","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_10startdialog_1_body_0":"LT? Some of my tools have disappeared from the Tool Shop.","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Has anyone seen my bird-scented cologne prototype, \"Soaring Sparrow: A Scent for Men\"?","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_10startdialog_3_body_0":"And my flask is missing. Great. OK folks! Keep calm! We may or may not have a serial burglar at the Outpost!","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_10startdialog_3_body_1":"Sheriff, you're a sheriff. Care to help us with the investigation?","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_20hint_0_body_0":"I reckon I could help you sleuth out the truth.","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_60reward_0_body_0":"I feel like a P.I. from one of my mystery novels!","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What's this thing?","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I thought you might benefit from some Imperial forensics tools to aid in your investigation of the crime scenes.","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Why don't you hold on to that, and I'll let you know when I need it.","mis_p01_xmas3_050_thief_70enddialog_2_body_1":"Everyone listen up! We got tracks headin' in two directions. We're gonna need to split into a couple groups to follow 'em.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_10startdialog_0_body_0":"These tracks are leadin' us toward the Raptor Nest.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh perfect. Whoever we're hunting is probably now being hunted by deadly raptors as well.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_10startdialog_1_body_1":"If we don't find them quickly, there might not be anyone left to arrest and punish.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_20hint_0_body_0":"The punishment's the fun part. Well, not for the punished.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_60reward_0_body_0":"I reckon I know where to head next.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I'm not seeing any people, or parts of people. I'm guessing the criminal isn't here anymore?","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Looks that way. I'm seein' some similar tracks to what I found at your Outpost headin' in this direction. Let me follow these a bit and I'll see where they're goin'.","mis_p01_xmas3_060_raptor_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Alright everyone! Give the Sheriff some room to work.","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright folks! Follow me! We gotta track this thief down and the tracks are headin' toward the Boar Lands.","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Lead the way Cassidy, we're right behind you. Be sure to tell me immediately if you see anything.","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Really Ramsey, I think I can take care of a few boars. I been huntin' boars in these parts for most of my life.","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_20hint_0_body_0":"Yeah, but I'm not worried about running into boars.","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_60reward_0_body_0":"This guy better watch out!","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_70enddialog_0_body_0":"See Ramsey? Nothin' to worry about. Now, back to what we came here for. I'm seein' some more of those tracks and they're goin' back toward your Outpost.","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Back? This thief must be a master of stealth. Is there anything else you're seeing?","mis_p01_xmas3_070_boar_70enddialog_2_body_0":"No, we should probably get back now. No point in us standin' out here in the freezin' cold. We still got a thief to catch!","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright Sheriff, where are the tracks headed this time?","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Looks like they're headed this way, towards the shore. They seem to stop at the end of this dock. You know where any of these ships were headed?","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yes sir. Those ships go through the Reef Bandit fishing grounds territory.","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, you might want to go out there and have a talk with 'em. Aren't those Reef Bandits known for stealin'?","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_20hint_0_body_0":"I wonder if they have any winter celebrations...","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_60reward_0_body_0":"Seriously? We've met him like, what, twice?","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perkins? Do you have those flash cards we got from the translator, Karin? Try talking to the Chief, see what he knows.","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_70enddialog_1_body_0":"The Chief doesn't know of any of his people stealing items from the Outpost. None of his people have been near it recently, according to him.","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well that's just swell. I guess we should head back now.","mis_p01_xmas3_080_reefbandits_70enddialog_3_body_0":"He also said he's insulted he wasn't invited to the celebration.","mis_p01_xmas3_090_shack_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ok we're back. Is anyone seeing anything? It doesn't look like the entire Outpost was looted while we were away, but everyone should check their stuff.","mis_p01_xmas3_090_shack_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I found some more tracks.

Why do you ask?","mis_p02_bigft_020_defeatbigfoots_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh, no reason.  I was just wondering what you knew about what bigfoots eat.","mis_p02_bigft_020_defeatbigfoots_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, they're omnivores, like most primates...  Again, why do you ask?","mis_p02_bigft_020_defeatbigfoots_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Because we need to deal with the several dozen bigfoots who have invaded our outpost and are eating every scrap of food we have.","mis_p02_bigft_020_defeatbigfoots_10startdialog_5_body_0":"What are you talking ab\u2013 Hey, there are bigfoots all over the place!

How about you concentrate on how to keep them from starving us to death?","mis_p02_bigft_020_defeatbigfoots_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, that's simple.  Either this culling will scare the others into moving on, or they'll do it themselves... once they've eaten all the food.","mis_p02_bigft_020_defeatbigfoots_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Marvelous.

The good news is, the bigfoots have moved on.","mis_p02_bigft_030_defeatbigfootsnorthfrontier_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I noticed.  Lack of bigfoots is just as obvious as their presence.  So what's the bad news?","mis_p02_bigft_030_defeatbigfootsnorthfrontier_10startdialog_2_body_0":"They had to go somewhere.

Don't they just live in sewers and eat people's garbage?","mis_p02_bigft_050_gotobigfoothabitat_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Now, Morgan, those are just myths. Bigfoots are actually clever, curious creatures.

Hmm.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, if I'm going to be working with these chemicals, I'll need a separate facility to examine and process them.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Say no more.  If we ever want to start using these chemical weapons ourselves, we'll need someplace designed to handle them anyway.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_20hint_0_body_0":"Exactly... Wait, what?","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_60reward_0_body_0":"Now we are all sons of bitches.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What's wrong?  Doesn't this meet all your specifications?","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes, but what's that you said before about USING the chemical weapons?  I thought I was just researching a way to counter them!","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Not the fun, low key Look-At-Those-Silly-Rebels war. We're fighting to survive. NOT using the chemicals puts us at a huge disadvantage against the Rebels.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_2_body_1":"You and I don't have the luxury of doing the right thing. We need to keep our people alive.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_2_title_0":"Floyd, we're at war.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Damn it, that's pretty compelling.","mis_p02_chem_047_chemfactory_70enddialog_3_title_0":"Yes, but...!","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey LT, do ya got a sec? With all the Rebels around, I... I feel like I'm goin' a little crazy.  I keep thinking about them going to Cariston and destroying everything... everyone... I've gotta do SOMETHING!","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, there might be something you can do. Do you think you might be wracked by ethical questions and doubts about the morality of using terrible agents of death against fellow human beings?","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Nope!","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's my girl! So we have all these lethal chemicals we've stolen from the Rebels, and I think it's high time we give them a taste of their own toxic medicine.  Any ideas?","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Hmmm. While I was down at the Barracks, they were trainin' Flame Troopers. I bet I could rig up somethin' like that, but for sprayin' poison instead.","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_20hint_0_body_0":"When you don't know what to do, improvise!","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_60reward_0_body_0":"The farmers ain't gettin' their sprayers back.","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Interesting getup you've created there.","mis_p02_chem_050_trainchemtrooper_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I used old fire extinguishers and borrowed some pesticide sprayers from the Farm.  It uses the same idea as our flamethrowers. Only instead of hot flaming death, it deals out gassy, choking death! Pretty cool, huh?","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You know, Morgan, now that we have Chem Troopers, we should test them under actual battle conditions...","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Sure. The Rebels will probably return to that chemical weapons lab.  We know the general region it must be in. If we intercept them somewhere along the way...","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Exactly. We can give them a taste of their own medicine!","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Did Floyd tell you that stuff is medicine? Because it's not.","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_20hint_0_body_0":"These Chem guys kinda creep me out.","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_60reward_0_body_0":"Perkins just needs a little extra help is all.","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Woo! It's sure different when this stuff is on OUR side. Those Rebels hardly knew what hit 'em!","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Your delight is both understandable and slightly frightening, Ramsey. At any rate, the Chem Troopers have proven their worth.","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Definitely. I'm thinking of training Perkins in gas handling and dispersal.","mis_p02_chem_060_attackrebels_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Seriously? You'd trust *Perkins* with chemical weapons?  Are you sure you didn't inhale some of that gas, Ramsey?","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Wow, it's amazing how unstable this chemical stuff is.  One wrong move, and you'd die a really HORRIBLE, NASTY death! It's so cool!","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I just wish we didn't have to spray it all over the place...","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Um... Yeah.  Cool.","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh, I've been thinkin' about that. What about grenades? Then we can throw the poison really far, an' we won't have to worry about the wind or nothin'!","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hmm, grenades... Could work!  Just... make sure the pins are in securely, all right?","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_20hint_0_body_0":"Sometimes I wonder if I'm enjoying this project TOO much...","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_60reward_0_body_0":"They're like the best Easter eggs ever!","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All done!","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Why are they so colorful?","mis_p02_chem_070_trainbiogrenadier_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, the kids wanted to help, so I let them decorate after I finished.","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"OK, Ramsey, these grenades are lighter than the plain-old explodey ones; y'all should probably teach the troops how to throw 'em right...","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"The Empire mandates realistic training scenarios! And there's nothing more realistic than gassing real Rebels!","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I feel like I should be slightly disturbed by your recent attitude, Ramsey. Huh. Have fun, boys!","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_20hint_0_body_0":"What? All I want is bloody revenge! Is that so wrong?","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_60reward_0_body_0":"Hey! I didn't spend all that time making bug bombs!","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The Rebels are getting meaner. I think they're angry we're interfering with their chemical salvaging operation.","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"All the more reason to keep on harassing them, then. I just wish WE knew where that hidden chemical lab was...","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We could use it - those Bio Grenadiers kicked ass out there!","mis_p02_chem_075_biogrenadierfight_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Sure did... Hey, let me have one of those grenades. My wine cellar has a bit of an ant problem.","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, we need to talk.","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, you're probably right. Your attitude is becoming...","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We need to go on the offensive.  Drive the Rebels back towards the south, away from us, AND from the Imperial lab - wherever it is.","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, you just wanted to talk about the Rebels again. Yeah, go ahead and shoot 'em or whatever.","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_20hint_0_body_0":"I thought Ramsey was finally opening up to me.","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_60reward_0_body_0":"Moral relativism!","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So, while I was watching the battles from a safe distance, upwind, I was thinking about the ethics of warfare.","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Uh\u2026 yeah?","mis_p02_chem_080_defeatrebels_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Basically, I've decided that if someone wants to kill me and everyone I know, I don't care if they get poisoned.","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey, LT, I'm still kinda nervous about the Rebels, but they gave me an idea. We can probably use these chemical weapons to protect our home, here.","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You have my attention.","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I was watchin' Yaro, Taro, and Daro play in our sprinkler system, and I thought, why not rig up somethin' like that to spray poison gas when it notices bad guys?","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Watching children at play made you want to set up sprinklers that will disperse deadly chemical weapons in the middle of our outpost?","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_10startdialog_4_body_0":"More or less?","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm so glad she's on our side.","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_60reward_0_body_0":"Hey, what are these metal hose things...?","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I'm a little uncertain about this...","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Oh, don't worry, LT! You'll be happy with the Chem Sprinklers when the Rebels attack!  Just don't jostle the spray nozzles... or trip the sensors... or light a match nearby...","mis_p02_chem_090_buildchemsprinklers_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I have to tell you, my confidence is not increasing here.","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Having deadly weapons of mass destruction is good, but you know what's better? Deadly weapons of mass destruction ON TANKS!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I've been workin' up a design based on the Flame Tanks that can spray poison like - everywhere - without putting the driver in much danger!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Now you're talkin'!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_20hint_0_body_0":"The test driver got hardly no burns at all!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_60reward_0_body_0":"Bring 'em on!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Finished! Whew! That's a fine lookin' piece of machinery if I ever saw one!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Let me guess, Ramsey: you want to test it out.","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_70enddialog_2_title_0":"Damn straight!","mis_p02_chem_100_trainlightchemtank_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well, don't worry; I'm sure the Rebels won't be giving up their... OUR chemical weapons that easily.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You look pale, Perkins. What's the matter? Floyd looking for \"volunteers\" again?","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_10startdialog_1_body_0":"No, sir! It's Rebels! They're everywhere! Literally everywhere, all over the frontier! It looks like they're hauling the chemicals away as fast as they can.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Morgan, I have an idea: we kill two birds with one stone again.  We follow them to the lab. Then we pounce, and kick their butts so hard they'll realize that using it is more trouble than it's worth.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Still, it's a good idea.  Go forth and slaughter, Sergeant.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_10startdialog_3_title_0":"Man, your plans sure are murder-heavy.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's get it done!","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_60reward_0_body_0":"Ramsey is kind of starting to worry me.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"That must be it! An Imperial lab, all the way out here...","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"An Imperial lab full of chemicals that could kill us all if we look at them funny.  I'm bringing Floyd in; I have a feeling we'll need him.","mis_p02_chem_110_defeatrebels_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Better hurry.  There are still Rebels in that lab, and I can't guarantee they'll still be here when you get back.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_10startdialog_0_body_0":"This equipment... That tang in the air... Yes!  This is definitely the Imperial chemical research lab!","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Morgan, I'm going in.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_10startdialog_1_title_0":"As if you couldn't tell from the Rebel presence.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Look, I know you're angry, but for god's sake, be careful! The Rebels will be desperate to hold on to this place.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_10startdialog_3_body_0":"And try not to damage any of the equipment!  Destroying anything could unleash a disastrous tide of gas over the entire area! It would kill all of us and probably upset the local ecology something fierce!","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm trying to be careful, but that's tricky with a minigun.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_60reward_0_body_0":"So did they move those chemicals from my footlocker?","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Damn, there's not much left. Floyd, any chance of getting this up and running again?","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_70enddialog_1_body_0":"After the damage Ramsey did? Not likely.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I said I was sorry!","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_70enddialog_3_body_0":"We've cut off the supply, but it looks like the Rebels were able to move the bulk of it out.","mis_p02_chem_120_labsiege_70enddialog_4_body_0":"I guess we'll just have to take it back the hard way.","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_10startdialog_0_body_0":"With all the refugees we're taking in and the soldiers we're training, our food supplies are starting to get stretched thin.  Without the Empire sending us support...","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Captain, we have a bit of a problem.","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I have an idea: a convenience store! That way, our troops can get lamp-warmed hot dogs and gallons of overcaffeinated energy drinks at all hours!","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Really, Morgan? Can't we do better than soda in cups larger than my head and cheese in colors that don't exist in nature?","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sorry, Floyd, beggars can't be choosers. I'm sure the rest of the outpost agrees.  Besides, all the extra fat will keep us going until we get more supplies.","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_20hint_0_body_0":"I can almost taste the sugar and cholesterol already!","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_60reward_0_body_0":"But that just raises more questions!","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Finally, it's open!  Smell that? That's the smell of modern progress! And mass-produced coffee that tastes like liquid road tar. Our food problems are solved!","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Wait a moment.  We built this abomination because we don't get food supplies from the Empire.  So where is the Convenience Store getting ITS food?","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It came pre-stocked with five years worth of prepackaged processed food-like products!  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a nacho binge to start...","mis_p02_cnvnc_010_buildconvstore_70enddialog_2_title_0":"That's the best part!","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Whoa! It's an earthquake!","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_10startdialog_1_body_0":"A whole herd of them coming straight for us!","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_10startdialog_1_title_0":"It's worse than an earthquake - it's mammoths!","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Really? But why? They've never bothered us like this before...","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Worry about that later! We have to get them out of here before they trample everything!","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_20hint_0_body_0":"Ugh...  I'm getting dizzy from the concentrated mammoth smell...","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_60reward_0_body_0":"We wouldn't have had this problem with healthy food.","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Whew, that's all of them.  But I wish we knew what brought them here in the first place.","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I've been studying the mammoth corpses, and discovered that they require an unusually high amount of caffeine in their diet to stay awake in their cold habitats.","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_70enddialog_1_title_0":"I think I can answer that.","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wait, you mean...?","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yes! They were attracted here by the Convenience Store and the smell of its coffee!  Sorry I didn't know before this, or I would've pushed against it even more strongly...","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Well, we're stuck with them now. No way is Morgan going to give up his morning coffee. I'll set up more patrols to keep them away from sensitive areas of the outpost.","mis_p02_cnvnc_020_defeatmammoths_enc_name":"Caffeinated Mammoths","mis_p02_colt_010_gotorecoil_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Mister Lieutenant Morgan?

What the hell is going on?","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Morgan. Damn. I was hoping this could wait. Look, these Silver Wolf fellas, they made me a deal, a deal I couldn't say no to and call myself responsible for these people. It's nothin' personal, I just\u2014","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Nothing personal? You're letting a bunch of murderous thugs stage troops just outside my backyard, and you tell me it's nothing personal? I never expected you could stoop this low!","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Now you watch yourself, youngun'! This ain't all black and white like you want it to be! I gotta do right by my folks!","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_10startdialog_4_body_0":"What happened to doing right by yourself?","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Why, you!","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_20hint_0_body_0":"This is unbelievable!","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_60reward_0_body_0":"I do what I have to.","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I told you not to push me!","mis_p02_colt_015_fightcolt_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Sheriff!

What now, you call Bronson and his thugs to come put us down?","mis_p02_colt_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Nah, these fools talk so dang much, I already know everything I need to know. I figure I'll let you go, and we can do that double reverse ambush you talked about.","mis_p02_colt_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh, already? Great!","mis_p02_colt_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wait\u2026 what?","mis_p02_colt_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I been on your side the whole time, ya damn fool!

Honestly, I think that Bronson is kinda lonely. He just wanted someone to talk to.","mis_p02_colt_020_fightwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"So, when were they planning to move on the Outpost?","mis_p02_colt_020_fightwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh, they've pretty much given up fightin' you on your home turf. They was planning to head east, and attack some secret Installation.

Luckily, so are we.","mis_p02_gantas_010_sundalefight_60reward_0_body_0":"Thank goodness! The bean curd crop was spared!","mis_p02_gantas_010_sundalefight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Maybe it was just a hallucination brought on by isolation and stress, but it looked like there were... Raiders with the Silver Wolves.","mis_p02_gantas_010_sundalefight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I saw 'em too. And they were working together with perfect coordination. Something's definitely fishy here.","mis_p02_gantas_010_sundalefight_70enddialog_2_body_0":"As if we didn't have enough problems. If the Silver Wolves are inflating their ranks with bribery or force, we're going to have a hard time keeping up. We need answers, and fast.","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_10startdialog_0_body_0":"My people... collaborating with the Silver Wolves? I have no knowledge of such a thing. Anyone among my tribe doing so would face... terrible consequences.","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Please, do me a favor and spare the details. So if they weren't with you, where'd they come from?","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I do not know. We are a proud people, unswayed by threats or promises of gold. There must be another reason behind their loyalty to the Silver Wolves.","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I know how we can find out! The Silver Wolves communicate by radio, right? If we can find the right frequency, we can intercept their messages and figure out what their next move is!","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_20hint_0_body_0":"Just don't stand too close to it while it's operatin'. Seriously, don't.","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_60reward_0_body_0":"When something goes wrong, hide.","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ah, Zoey... The northeast quadrant just had a blackout.","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I know... The Interceptor takes a *little* more power than I thought it would. But we'll be able to listen in on the Silver Wolves' next communication, no problem!","mis_p02_gantas_020_makeinterceptor_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I hope so. In the meantime, we need to get the electricity back up. Can you hook up a stationary bike to the power generators? Get Perkins to handle it.","mis_p02_gantas_030_trotbeckfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"LT! I'm picking up a broadcast from the Silver Wolves! They're gonna attack Trotbeck next!","mis_p02_gantas_030_trotbeckfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ah, I love having surprise on my side! Come on, men, let's prepare a good old fashioned ambush!","mis_p02_gantas_030_trotbeckfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Only thing better than a \"boom\" is a surprise \"boom\"!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"People of Trotbeck, surrender now or blah blah...","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I don't believe it! You're with the Silver Wolves?!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Gantas?!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh. It is you.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_3_body_0":"What do you mean \"oh, it's you\"?! It's those Imperial dolts! The ones who took your honor! Remember?!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Yes. I remember.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_5_body_0":"So what are you gonna do about it?! Attack them! Make them pay for what they did to you!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_10startdialog_6_body_0":"I suppose I should. Men, march to your deaths.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Maybe it's my imagination, but Gantas seems a little... off.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_60reward_0_body_0":"In the meantime, we have a mystery to solve!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Silver Wolves, retreat! You'll all pay for this!","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes. Dishonor to all your kind. Your foolish ways will be your undoing. Very bad stuff.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Was that really Gantas? He sure has changed since the last time we saw him.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Then again, the last time we saw him, he was on fire. Those were good days. I'd like to have 'em back.","mis_p02_gantas_035_actualtrotbeckfight_enc1_name":"Silver Wolf Raiders","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_10startdialog_0_body_0":"If Warlord Gantas has really joined the Silver Wolves, he must have fallen on hard times indeed. The humiliation of being an underling to such dogs has surely sapped his spirit.","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I never thought I'd say this, but I feel a little sorry for him. Besides, having someone like him, with his loyalist troops, under the Silver Wolves' thumb could be dangerous...","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Fan out and attack! Don't let anyone escape! This outpost falls today!","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_10startdialog_3_body_0":"You heard him. Go and do what he said.","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Case in point.","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_20hint_0_body_0":"Fighting these guys is like trying to stomp an anthill, I swear...","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_60reward_0_body_0":"I'll take Gantas over the Silver Wolves any day of the week, and twice on Tuesdays!","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Arrgh! You were supposed to back us up, make us strong enough to take down these bastards! I should've known Raiders were just a bunch of idiot weaklings!","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I suppose we are.","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Whoa, you're taking that lying down? Are you sure you're the REAL Gantas?","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yeah, he is! He just knows when to join up with winners! And the Silver Wolves are winners, right, Gantas?","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_70enddialog_4_body_0":"More so than me.","mis_p02_gantas_040_defeatinvasion_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Okay, I'm not saying I miss the old Gantas, but I at least knew what I was dealing with. This is totally bumming me out.","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_10startdialog_0_body_0":"That does it! I've had it with you just sitting back and giving orders all day! You're gonna get out there and earn your keep by getting rid of the Imperials once and for all!","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I will do what is necessary to be left in peace.","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Gantas, what's happened to you? You used to be so full of life... and murderous rage! You're better than this! Remember the good old days, when you were trying to kill us?","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Lay off! Career transitions can be very stressful! As for trying to kill you, you're not gonna miss that for long!","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_20hint_0_body_0":"Prepare to meet your doom, and... *sigh* Is there a point to any of this?","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_60reward_0_body_0":"Uh, Empire? Think you can... help me? Please?","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Battle! Real battle! Magnificent! My blood burns with the heat of warfare once more!","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Who cares! You LOST, you moron! You Raiders are worthless! Worthl\u2014 GAK! C-can't... br-breathe...","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I tire of insults against me and my people. I tire of the Silver Wolves. I tire of YOU. I will deal with you personally in a moment. But as for you, Imperials...","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_2_body_1":"You have reminded me what it means to be a proud warrior. I was an honored warlord once; I can become one again. I cannot let a single failure weigh upon me for the rest of my life.","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_2_body_2":"I shall leave you now. That is my gratitude towards you... and so I can \"repay\" the \"kindness\" shown to me by the Silver Wolves. When I return, mightier than ever... only then will I avenge myself upon you with the wrath you deserve.","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_2_title_1":"Thank you.","mis_p02_gantas_050_fightgantas_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Whew, the world makes sense again. And I'm sure what we just did will have absolutely no consequences that will come back to haunt us.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I came as soon as I heard! You've really saved him? You got Archibald - that is, the Administrator - you got him back from the Silver Wolves?","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Damn right, we did! He's one of those guys... right?","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wh-why do you have him tied up? Is he being held prisoner?","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_10startdialog_3_body_0":"The Silver Wolves had all these guys, and we've been trying to sort out who's safe to let go and who's not. So... kind of?","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Aurora! Who are these people? Please help me!","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Sorry about that, we'll fix him up. Get him a hot meal and a fresh pair of boots.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_20hint_0_body_0":"Nobody doesn't want new boots.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_60reward_0_body_0":"Perkins, figure out who the rest of these guys are.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Sorry about the whole leaving you bound and gagged thing. Can't be too careful.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You could have asked me.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You could have lied. I would have.","mis_p02_getlaser_010_helpadmin_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Hmmm. Fair enough.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Aurora, it's good to see you. Any news?","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Nothing good. If there are any Imperial resistance cells still operating, they've gone dark. We haven't heard anything in months. As far as we can tell, these guys are the only Imperial holdouts left.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yup. Just us. Oh, she forgot all the stuff about Rebels in the Heartland, and the roving gangs of thugs, but since they were holding you prisoner, you're probably familiar with them.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Indeed. It seems I owe you thanks for more than my rescue.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You know what would have made all of that easier? If we had some lasers. That would be nice. If only someone who knew how to develop and operate lasers owed us their lives, and had all hopes for their continued existence intertwined with our own.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Your point is made. Assuming Aurora approves, I'd be willing to give you the plans to create a facility capable of basic laser production. We can move forward from there.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_20hint_0_body_0":"I don't see any significant alternatives.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_60reward_0_body_0":"The potential applications are incredible!","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_70enddialog_0_body_0":"There you are, Lieutenant Morgan. You've taken quite the burden on your shoulders. I sincerely hope you know what you're doing.","mis_p02_getlaser_020_buildoptics_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I'm making laser weapons to smite my enemies. Right?","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, while I'm excited about the military applications of our new laser tech, I don't think we should underestimate the potential civic value. I think I can make cuts on the order of 5% from our average build time if\u2014","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Here's an idea: how about I arm our troops FIRST, and then you can survive to do some experiments or whatever when we're not all living in constant fear for our very lives?","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I suppose you have a point... still, I don't think we should undervalue the cost savings afforded by laser-honed skill saws.","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_20hint_0_body_0":"Lasers! Finally!","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_60reward_0_body_0":"Almost as sweet as a micron edged skill saw.","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Gentlemen, I stand before you at the dawn of a new era. The era of shooting perfectly round cauterized holes into our enemies.","mis_p02_getlaser_030_trainlaser_70enddialog_0_body_1":"I'm not going to lie to you guys. It's a pretty sweet era.","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, before we go rushing out into combat with these new Laser Troopers, don't you think it would be appropriate to do a bit of field testing?","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Floyd, are you asking because you want to verify the quality of our work, or because you want to watch guys blow stuff up with Lasers?","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_10startdialog_2_title_0":"A little of both?","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_20hint_0_body_0":"Nothing beats a good field test!","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_60reward_0_body_0":"I don't really envy them ever.","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, I'd call that a success.","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Indeed. I don't envy the Silver Wolves right now.","mis_p02_getlaser_040_testlaser_enc1_name":"Laser Field Test","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Now that we are... allies of a sort, I'd like to ask for your assistance in a delicate matter.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ehh, why not? We're rescuing everyone and their great-grandma lately.  At least you guys have cool weapons.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It is exactly those, ahem, \"cool weapons\" that are at issue here.  We were delivering crates containing highly advanced weapon prototypes to Cariston right before the Empire fell. They vanished somewhere along the way. We want them back.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, at least we know the Rebels don't have them, then.  The Raiders were busy with us at the time, so that leaves the Silver Wolves.  Of course.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I wager the Silver Wolves are still hungry for new technology and weapons, especially with the problems we're giving them. Perhaps if we were to offer them another \"shipment\" of weapons, we could draw them out.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_20hint_0_body_0":"Add enough blinking lights, and anything looks high tech!","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_60reward_0_body_0":"Beeping... flashing... so... hypnotic...","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So we're offering the Silver Wolves actual laser rifles? Why don't we just lend them a few tanks while we're at it?","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_70enddialog_1_body_0":"These rifles look impressive, but their power output is extremely low.  If we want to attract the Silver Wolves, they have to at least appear functional.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_70enddialog_2_body_0":"And that thing?","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_70enddialog_3_body_0":"It... beeps.  And sparks.  And has little flashing lights.  That's... about it.","mis_p02_gettech_010_maketech_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Well, the Silver Wolves aren't exactly technical geniuses... or strategic geniuses, or really any kind of genius. I think this has a shot at working - they're pretty dumb.","mis_p02_gettech_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Aurora, if we're going to make this fake shipment look good to the Silver Wolves, we'll need your help.","mis_p02_gettech_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Of course.  I can chart the exact route the first shipment took.  I doubt the bandits will have changed their habits much.","mis_p02_gettech_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Our men will be disguised as Installation scientists, so the Silver Wolves think the caravan is the real deal. Aurora, if you can loan us some Laser Technicians, that would help even more. We'll leave when you're ready.","mis_p02_gettech_020_fightwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"I love surprise parties!","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir! There's someone approaching from the mountains!","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Stay alert, men! This could be it!","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It's them, all right! Hand it over, nerds. If you put up a fight, you'll wind up as dead as that last group.","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, yeah? You're the one who will be dead! I mean... Aw man, that was awful. Let's just shoot these guys!","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"C'mon, Ramsey, keep it together!","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"Hey, I didn't have lunch...  Ya got a snack on ya somewhere...?","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Now talk! What'd you do with the last shipment you hijacked?","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I... I ain't tellin' ya squat! Whatever you do to me is nothin' compared to what Mr. Stephenson and the boss would do if they find out I squealed!","mis_p02_gettech_021_fightwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Damn. Well, let's take these jokers back to the outpost as POWs. We'll figure out our next move there.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Well, no luck interrogating the prisoners. They're all too scared to talk.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I think Floyd and I may be able to help. We've been examining soil samples from the Silver Wolves' boots.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"The samples have unique properties and chemical traces that are found in only one location within a two hundred mile radius of here.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_10startdialog_3_body_0":"It's worth checking out.  But be prepared for anything, Ramsey; I don't put anything past the Silver Wolves.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Before you go, Ramsey, are your rabies shots up to date?","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_60reward_0_body_0":"I must say, you all have certainly made my life more... interesting.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I'd say that welcome means we're in the right place.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I haven't detected any energy signatures from the prototypes stolen from us. But they could have it shielded or stored underground.","mis_p02_gettech_030_artilleryfight_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Then we don't have any choice: we go in. Better to not leave a bunch of Silver Wolves camped out this close to our outpost anyway.","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, men, let's move in!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ah, pardon... I just got a communique from the installation, and...","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Sorry, ma'am, no time.  Now that we know where the Silver Wolves are, we need to strike fast before they move your prototypes somewhere else.","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"But\u2026!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Let's go, men! Don't you worry, Aurora, we'll take care of this!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's show these jokers who's boss around here!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"Then again, beating up Silver Wolves is kind of its own reward.","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Let's see if the stuff's still there.  Now the Installation can have back their... thermal underwear?!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Found the crates!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That's what I was trying to tell you before. It seems that our shipping clerk mixed up a couple of labels. We had the prototypes in our winter weather storeroom all along!","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"...","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I theorize the Silver Wolves were either embarrassed, or just never had a chance to open the crates.  I'd call it funny, but I don't suppose you'd think so.","mis_p02_gettech_040_defeatwolves_70enddialog_4_body_0":"You've got that right.","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, do you remember being certain something was up with the Silver Wolves?","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yes...","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"They've moved the bulk of their forces to Installation 17. It's a full scale assault. They were keeping us busy at New Haven and blocking the Installation's radio signals.","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Perkins, what in the world makes you think it's appropriate to deliver that information with a cute \"remember being certain blah blah blah?\" I mean, you disappoint me almost constantly, but this is really a new low.","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_10startdialog_3_body_1":"I can't believe... Perkins, I need you to leave for a while. Everyone else, put your boots back on.","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"I was just trying to establish context...","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"She better be fine.","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"No time to rest! You lazy sons of bitches get back on your feet and move!","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Woah Sergeant, take it\u2014","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Cassidy's in there, Morgan. She's in there.","mis_p02_i17attack_010_fightwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I'm sure she's fine Sergeant.","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Defenses at I17 are failing! We need to move!","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm coming, Cass!","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_60reward_0_body_0":"Fine.","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_70enddialog_0_title_0":"God DAMN it!","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We didn't... They're in, sir. We caught a lot of them, but the Silver Wolves made it inside, and sealed the building. What are we going\u2014","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We're gonna blow the damn doors off!","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"It wouldn't work. We need to go back to the Outpost. Talk to Floyd and Zoey. They'll know how to get us in.","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_70enddialog_4_body_0":"I'm staying.","mis_p02_i17attack_020_fightmorewolves_70enddialog_5_body_0":"You can't just sit in the snow and freeze to death. That doesn't help anyone. Trust me on this Ramsey. We'll be back, and we'll get them out. All of them.","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_10startdialog_0_body_0":"First, we gotta disable the electronic locks. Right now, the doors ain't just locked, they're forcin' themselves together. Floyd'll make an EMP discharger that'll give me time to pry the things open.","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_10startdialog_0_title_0":"We got it all worked out, LT!","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_10startdialog_1_body_0":"How long until you're ready to move, Floyd?","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Less than a day? Though, Morgan, something's been bothering me... The Silver Wolves \u2014 all my field interviews imply they've always been disorganized and short sighted. Yet since the fall of the Empire, they've suddenly been galvanized into\u2014","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_10startdialog_3_body_0":"One thing at a time, buddy. Remember our talks about prioritization?","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_20hint_0_body_0":"If I'm right, our priorities will shift rather radically.","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_60reward_0_body_0":"Zoey's plans are always... interesting.","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_70enddialog_0_body_0":"There you are, phase one of the plan. Activating that will disable all the electronic aspects of the locks at Installation 17. After that, it's just a matter of actually forcing the two 1,578,240 pound doors apart.","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_70enddialog_1_body_0":"A million and a half pounds? Each?","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Whoa!","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I did my calculations assuming a standard density for steel at 68 degrees, but since Installation 17 is well below freezing, the density would be higher, and given that I'm working off the actual dimensions of the doors, they're likely somewhat heavier.","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_70enddialog_2_title_0":"Roughly?","mis_p02_i17attack_030_buildemp_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Don't sweat it LT! I got a plan!","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Alright LT, here's my plan. We build a real big wedge, we put an engine in it and treads on it, and we force the doors open.","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_10startdialog_1_body_0":"No bombs or anything?","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Seriously?","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_10startdialog_2_body_0":"The doors're on tracks! It'd take forever to blow 'em up, but they're designed to be pulled apart. Trust me LT!","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, you've done a lot of stuff that sounded crazier than this, and most of it much more likely to kill me. Proceed.","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_20hint_0_body_0":"I wouldn't call this plan \"unlikely\" to kill you exactly.","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_60reward_0_body_0":"That converts to 281 Centiclovers in metric.","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, that should do it. With these and a bit of luck, we'll be cracking I17 open in no time.","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Just how lucky will we need to be?","mis_p02_i17attack_040_buildwedge_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I'm... not aware of an extant unit of measurement for luck. Maybe .38 Rabbit's Feet?","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I can't just wait around, sir. I need to keep busy.","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Understood, Ramsey. Why don't you head out to the Eastern Wastes, keep the Silver Wolves from reinforcing.","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Glad to.","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_20hint_0_body_0":"Sometimes you just need to keep busy.","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_60reward_0_body_0":"I just want some direction!","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_70enddialog_0_body_0":"They stopped sending guys. I guess word got back.","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sorry pal. If you'd let a few through, they might have kept sending them out.","mis_p02_i17attack_050_fightreinforcements_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I'll admit, I considered it.","mis_p02_i17attack_060_gotoi17_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Me and Floyd're all set LT! We're ready to go!","mis_p02_i17attack_060_gotoi17_10startdialog_1_body_0":"All right folks, let's move 'em out.","mis_p02_i17attack_060_gotoi17_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh, I should note, don't have any electronics, machines or people you care about near the EMP Discharger when you set it off.","mis_p02_i17attack_060_gotoi17_10startdialog_3_body_0":"How near is too near?","mis_p02_i17attack_060_gotoi17_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well, if you trigger the discharge, then run away as fast as you can, that's probably far enough.","mis_p02_i17attack_060_gotoi17_20hint_0_body_0":"I really don't want to handle this.","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Doors are open LT!","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_10startdialog_1_body_0":"How long will the wedge hold?","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I don't think the wedge is going anywhere, kinda ever. It's jammed in there pretty good.","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Let's move carefully, there are a LOT of civilians down there, and we're here to rescue them, not catch them in friendly fire.","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_10startdialog_3_title_0":"Alright 95th!","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_20hint_0_body_0":"You catch Cassidy in friendly fire, start running.","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_60reward_0_body_0":"Ramsey is scary.","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You wanna stop cowering behind scientists for a few minutes and get what's coming?","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Bronson!","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Be careful now, I have some very important hostages.","mis_p02_i17attack_065_invadei17_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You lay one finger... we're gonna find out how long I can keep you alive and bleeding.","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"It's over Bronson. The feint at New Haven, taking I17, it was smart, but it's too late.","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Funny, Stephenson was sure you wouldn't be able to get in here in time... He was usually right about this kinda stuff. He was right about almost everything from the day he showed up.","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, he picked a hell of a time to be wrong.","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Wonder if I'll get my hands on Stephenson before this is over.","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_60reward_0_body_0":"Hell of a girl.","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Ramsey!","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Are you okay?","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Cass!","mis_p02_i17attack_070_bronsonfight_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Fine. Hungry. I hid in the vents for days. Picked 'em off.

Sergeant, get these people to safety!","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm not letting Bronson out of my sight!","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I've got him! You go!","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_10startdialog_4_body_0":"If either of y'all thinks I'm leaving without putting some rounds into that sucker, you're dearly mistaken.","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_20hint_0_body_0":"There's plenty of Bronson to go around.","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_60reward_0_body_0":"It'll be very cozy down there.","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Hey, how come we're not blown up?","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_70enddialog_1_body_0":"He was clearly lying about the explosives. I assumed you knew.","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_70enddialog_2_body_0":"\u2026 I did?","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Lieutenant... it's hard to believe I once hesitated to trust you. Thank you, thank you so much.","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Don't sweat it. I don't exactly scream \"trustworthy\". Anything you can do with the surviving Silver Wolves?","mis_p02_i17attack_080_bronsonbattle_70enddialog_5_body_0":"We have some very, VERY secure test chambers in the lower floors of Installation 17.

Sure.","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm from an Imperial Science Corps research installation. We're running low on some basic supplies, and well, our reports indicate you guys have been pretty great about helping the local towns.","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, I don't really have the authority to approve any of this, but... gosh, you seem sincere! Why not?","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_20hint_0_body_0":"What could go wrong?","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_60reward_0_body_0":"Huh.

Have a good trip!","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Who was that?","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh, some scientist lady. She runs a secret installation out here. Needed some supplies, so I helped her out.","mis_p02_i17contact_010_turninsupplies_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Quick! Someone stop her! I have questions!","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ma'am! Pardon me! Please don't leave.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Excuse me, I'm really in quite a hurry.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I was hoping to discuss the manufacture and operation of the portable laser device. I'm guessing you might have some insight I'd find invaluable.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Damn. Look, I appreciate the help, and if I had anything I could afford to give back, I would, but there's no way I'm giving my research to the first group of Imperial survivors I see. I need to protect my people.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I have no intention of seizing your research, but I'd like a chance to talk. Hold tight, I'll grab us some lunch.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_20hint_0_body_0":"Where am I gonna find lunch?","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_60reward_0_body_0":"Another adherent of Science!","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_70enddialog_0_body_0":"interesting meal.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_70enddialog_0_title_0":"This is an...","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sorry, I wanted something enticing and... I kind of panicked. Regardless, I was hoping we could discuss your situation. Now, if you're set up like a standard Imperial Installation, you'll have both a Chief Technical Officer and a Chief Administrator. I have to say I'm surprised to see you here instead of the Administrator.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_70enddialog_2_body_0":"He's... indisposed. Look, I'm really not comfortable discussing the specifics of my Installation. I try to avoid going out, but I didn't know what else to do. We're in bad shape.","mis_p02_i17contact_020_makelunch_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well, perhaps we can help each other out.","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Look, you seem like decent people, but so did the last guys I dealt with, and that went poorly.","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Since you're being direct, I shall be so as well. While your outpost and breakthroughs are of great personal interest, your advances in weaponry would allow us to turn the tide against these Silver Wolves, and ensure safety in the region.","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_10startdialog_2_body_0":"OK, let's say you're successful. What then? Our prototypes won't hold off the rebels. And what happens if the power goes to your heads? What if there's some kind of coup in your outpost? I can't risk releasing the laser technology.","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Perhaps I can help you feel a little more secure?","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, man! I bet they have a mass spectrometer!","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_60reward_0_body_0":"Lightning Troopers! Where did these come from?","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Look, Floyd, you seem very nice, and I'd love to sit down some time and discuss some of our findings, but the laser technology is simply off the table.","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I fully understand. Is there anything that ISN'T off the table?","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Hmm. We have some prototype lightning tech I'd be willing to walk you through.","mis_p02_i17contact_030_makesecurity_70enddialog_3_body_0":"It's a start!","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_10startdialog_0_body_0":"our hands on the laser weapons from that Aurora lady.","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_10startdialog_0_title_0":"We've got to get","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_10startdialog_1_body_0":"She's made it very clear she has no intention of parting with that research.","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, but she's never seen ME turn on the charm!","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_20hint_0_body_0":"I cannot say I'm comfortable with this.","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_60reward_0_body_0":"I can woo this girl. I can woo ANYONE.","mis_p02_i17contact_040_makegifts_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perfect. I send her the gifts, and we just wait for her to show up and swoon into my arms.

That casin' you folks made sure was impressive. I had a heck of a time breaking it open.","mis_p02_i17contact_050_maketools_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You were able to break it open without damaging the interior? It was designed specifically to make that impossible.

Did she really build all those devices herself?","mis_p02_i17contact_050_maketools_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Indeed, along with more than half of this Outpost. I don't suppose you're looking for interns?","mis_p02_i17contact_050_maketools_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Interns? If I still had funding, she'd be running her own research team!","mis_p02_i17war_010_coldwar_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Reports are in, sir. The Silver Wolves have started sending troops east.

Let's get the men ready to move.","mis_p02_i17war_010_coldwar_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Sir, I'm not sure we're ready. The weather in the Eastern Wastes is rough.

While we were getting our things together, the Silver Wolves started attacking the Installation!","mis_p02_i17war_030_installationfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Did she give us coordinates for the base, by chance?","mis_p02_i17war_030_installationfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"She didn't encode the signal nearly as well as she usually does, which is basically the same thing.

I don't know if we... we held them off, but we suffered some pretty heavy damage. And the casualties... oh, Floyd. They're just scientists, they don't know how to...","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm just sorry we couldn't get here sooner. We'll want disinfectant and bandages for the wounded, and some metal patch kits for the structural damage.","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We're in your hands. I wouldn't have known what to do. I just... we have no experience with this kind of thing.","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sadly, we do.","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_20hint_0_body_0":"No time to waste.","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm glad Archibald is keeping himself occupied.","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Good man, Floyd. I consider this further proof that you were the right lot to throw in with. With which to throw in... in with which to throw? I'm sorry. I'm quite out of sorts.","mis_p02_i17war_040_makehealers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Quite all right. We're here to help.","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, Sergeant Ramsey is back from the wastes!","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ramsey, give me good news.","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Glad to be able to. Silver Wolves were inbound, but storms have scrambled them. They're lost all over the Eastern Wasteland.","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Finally, some luck. Let's move out and clean them up before they can regroup.","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"This was lucky, but don't get used to it.","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"I can't believe it worked again!","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Sir, I'm worried that this is going a little too smoothly.

That, once again, the Silver Wolves have diverted my attention from the real target? Because - and I think this is clear - we have their real target, Installation 17, extremely well defended and\u2014","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Just got word, Lieutenant: Silver Wolves are attacking the outpost.","mis_p02_i17war_050_defeatwolves_70enddialog_3_title_0":"Seriously? Man, dang it!","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Oh man, what if this is some kind of double feint, and he's actually back at I17 right now!","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_10startdialog_1_body_0":"All due respect, sir? It doesn't matter. Silver Wolves are attacking our people, and we're going to stop them.","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"A fair point, Sergeant.","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_20hint_0_body_0":"Sometimes Morgan thinks too much.","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm just kooky that way!","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"How's it feel, mister Morgan? Always scrambling to keep up? Never in control? And to know it's your fault? After all, you could have avoided this.","mis_p02_i17war_060_bigoutpostfight_70enddialog_1_body_0":"When you and your Silver Wolves shoot innocent people, no matter how you spin it, I don't think it's my fault. I don't know, maybe I'm weird.","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Zoey, I'm really sorry, but...","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You need to get back to I17. I understand. You head back - I'll get the ol' Outpost back in shape in no time!","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_20hint_0_body_0":"Wrap a bandage and splash on some paint!","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_60reward_0_body_0":"They wouldn't get ten feet in that cold anyway!","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All right. We've got the Outpost back on its legs. Now we just gotta wait for news.","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Zoeyyyyyy, c'mon! Let us go help!","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I told you kids, no driving your tank to war until you're all thirteen.","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_70enddialog_3_body_0":"NO FAIR!","mis_p02_i17war_070_makepatches_70enddialog_3_title_0":"Awwwww!","mis_p02_i17war_080_bigi17fight_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We've got incoming, sirs.

They've got some pretty incredible numbers.","mis_p02_i17war_080_bigi17fight_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Are we going to be all right?","mis_p02_i17war_080_bigi17fight_10startdialog_3_body_0":"You and me? Yes. Everyone else? I'm not so sure.","mis_p02_i17war_080_bigi17fight_20hint_0_body_0":"Just try me!","mis_p02_i17war_080_bigi17fight_60reward_0_body_0":"He wouldn't let me have even a moment of victory.","mis_p02_i17war_080_bigi17fight_70enddialog_0_body_0":"They're pulling back.

There are more of us than you could ever hope to stop. We're gonna swallow you up.","mis_p02_i17war_090_bossbattle_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Not over, huh?  You know what, he's right. This is the beginning. This guy thinks he knows war? He's never seen anything. We'll show him war. We'll show him the Imperial Army. No more playing defense, no more scrambling.","mis_p02_i17war_090_bossbattle_70enddialog_1_body_1":"This is the army that conquered Ateria. This is the army that controlled most of the known world for half a century.

That you're gonna swallow us up?

Really.","mis_p02_jlbrk_010_jailbreak1_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Damn right.","mis_p02_jlbrk_010_jailbreak1_20hint_0_body_0":"I didn't come this far to get caught.","mis_p02_jlbrk_010_jailbreak1_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm a very lucky man.","mis_p02_jlbrk_010_jailbreak1_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Again, I'm sor\u2014","mis_p02_jlbrk_010_jailbreak1_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ramsey, you're sorry, great. We'll talk about it later. We've kinda got a lot going on right now.","mis_p02_jlbrk_010_jailbreak1_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Right. Good point.","mis_p02_jlbrk_020_jailbreak2_10startdialog_0_body_0":"OK, boys, looks like we're in a bad way up ahead. Any ideas?","mis_p02_jlbrk_020_jailbreak2_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We could have one of the Demolitionists steal that Flame Tank. That oughta give us an edge.","mis_p02_jlbrk_020_jailbreak2_10startdialog_2_title_0":"I knew there was a reason I liked you.","mis_p02_jlbrk_020_jailbreak2_20hint_0_body_0":"There's a reason she likes me!","mis_p02_jlbrk_020_jailbreak2_60reward_0_body_0":"It's okay.

I'll take this tank due west, throw them off the trail, and catch up with you.","mis_p02_jlbrk_030_jailbreak3_70enddialog_1_body_0":"If you think I'm letting you out of my sight, you're nuts.","mis_p02_jlbrk_030_jailbreak3_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Works for me.

Ramsey! You're back! Great work, Cassidy!

We got your laser gun. Don't make me regret this.","mis_p02_laser_010_battlelasertroops_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I have the full might of the scientific method behind me.

It's money.","mis_p02_makewlf_010_buildvault_20hint_0_body_0":"Nothing says \"loyalty\" like bribery!","mis_p02_makewlf_010_buildvault_60reward_0_body_0":"Certainty is comforting!","mis_p02_makewlf_010_buildvault_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So now that we can recruit Silver Wolves, how do we know we can trust them?

Shots fired... it's all pretty vague.","mis_p02_marin_010_golook_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, I'm sure once we get down there and fire some shots back everything will get a lot less vague.","mis_p02_marin_010_golook_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'll get the men moving.","mis_p02_marin_010_golook_20hint_0_body_0":"I find things get a lot less vague after a few shots.","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Not too many, probably a scouting party.

Did I already send Perkins down here to take care of this? It gets hard to keep track of after a while...","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Negative, Lieutenant. These aren't our men.","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, what do you say we give these fine folks a hand?","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_20hint_0_body_0":"Seriously, you try keeping track of all the fights I get into. It's rough!","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_60reward_0_body_0":"Am I famous?","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I gotta tell you guys, it's a hell of a pleasant surprise to see some friendly faces out here. I'm Lieutenant Morgan with the 95th Rifles and\u2014","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You're the guys making life complicated for the rest of us.","mis_p02_marin_020_fightrebels_70enddialog_1_title_0":"We know who you are, Morgan.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I guess we have been pretty active lately, meeting lots of people...

Hell no. We're here, protecting Imperial citizens and trying to keep this city from falling apart.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Because I know to keep a low profile and get the job done.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We've been doing that too. Just, you know, in lots of little cities instead of one big one. Though the Outpost is getting to be quite the little city itself...","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_10startdialog_3_body_0":"And making giant targets out of yourselves and every city you visit while you're at it. Look, you love helping so much? Marin doesn't need your guns. We need your steel. Lots of repairs here, not enough steel.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_20hint_0_body_0":"Maybe one of the things that needs repairs is his manners.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_60reward_0_body_0":"Man, I used to be so good at marching. Just super good.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You know, we've actually got a pretty healthy level of steel production going. Not to mention food, medicine, that kind of thing.

If you folks want to run up and down the Frontier, that's fine, but we're gonna take care of our own. That's what soldiers do.","mis_p02_marin_030_turninsteel_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Also we march a lot.

They've got some good points about the way we're overextending ourselves, and it would be really valuable if we could have them as allies...","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, we could take out the Silver Wolves that are camped outside Marin. That would probably help win them over.","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Woah, Silver Wolves? Why haven't we already jumped on this?","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"This was exactly the kind of help they said they didn't want. I'm generally pretty good at listening to orders.","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"I mean, lately.","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"So this is righteous indignation...","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What the hell do you think you're doing?","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Protecting you from murderous thugs?","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"The Silver Wolves get a little food and some of that steel you gave us and they leave us alone.","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_70enddialog_2_title_0":"We had an agreement!","mis_p02_marin_040_silverwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"You paid them off? With OUR steel?","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You took our steel, which you claimed you needed for repairs, and used it to pay off the Silver Wolves?!","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We said we needed it to keep Marin safe. And that's what we did.","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You gave aid to the enemy!","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Our enemy is the Rebel army, and the Silver Wolves are the only thing keeping them from swarming the Frontier and killing or imprisoning every last one of us!","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_3_body_1":"If you weren't so caught up trying to do the right thing, you'd do the smart thing and get out of their way!","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_4_body_0":"So we should roll over and ignore people in need like you cowards?","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Men, let's show this pompous ass what cowards we are!","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_20hint_0_body_0":"Hit 'em hard, Rifles!","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_60reward_0_body_0":"How many people have died on your watch?","mis_p02_marin_050_civilwar_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I'm not wasting any more time, blood, or bullets on you people.

They lie, they give aid and comfort to the enemy, they attack us, and you're sending them food?","mis_p02_marin_060_makenice_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That's still a city full of Imperial citizens. They still need food and aid. It's not their fault they're protected by dicks.","mis_p02_marin_060_makenice_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I have to agree with Morgan. A lot of people are effectively trapped there. Perhaps our generosity will inspire change from within.","mis_p02_marin_060_makenice_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I wouldn't count on it.","mis_p02_marin_060_makenice_20hint_0_body_0":"All right boys.

I really feel like we're doing good.","mis_p02_marin_060_makenice_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Do you think so? Are we making the right choice? Are we just perpetuating conflict and putting lives at risk?","mis_p02_marin_060_makenice_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I think you could ask any person in Recoil Ridge, or Sundale, or any of the other little towns we've helped. We're making a difference.","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hello, Lieutenant. I hear you've been making yourself useful around these parts. I didn't think you all had it in you, but I'm glad this was one of those rare times I was wrong.","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Thanks... I think.  But you don't strike me as the kind who just stops by to issue mildly backhanded compliments...","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_10startdialog_2_body_0":"And you would be right. I don't believe the Silver Wolves are gone. I'm certain they're somewhere nearby, laying low for a future surprise attack. I think this is the time to sniff them out, before they can put any plots into motion.","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's actually a good idea.  I wouldn't trust the Silver Wolves as far as I can throw them.  And frankly, I throw like a little girl.","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Unfortunately, I don't have any information as to where they might be hiding out.  You'll just have to search some of the frontier towns until you find 'em. I wish you luck \u2014 for all our sakes.","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_20hint_0_body_0":"We'll have to search for the wolves in Sundale, Skarborough, Marin, and Recoil.

Marin is crawling with Silver Wolves!","mis_p02_marinsw_010_visitmarin_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Looks like Ma was right on the money. This is still our territory, as far as I'm concerned. It's time to show the Silver Wolves just what we do to trespassers.","mis_p02_marinsw_011_visitrecoil_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Howdy there, sheriff.  Seen any Silver Wolves around here lately?","mis_p02_marinsw_011_visitrecoil_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Nope.","mis_p02_marinsw_011_visitrecoil_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Any unusual activity anywhere in the region?","mis_p02_marinsw_011_visitrecoil_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Nope.","mis_p02_marinsw_011_visitrecoil_10startdialog_4_body_0":"...

You seen any Silver Wolves around here?","mis_p02_marinsw_012_visitsundale_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We haven't, thank Mother Nature.  But if we do, maybe we can turn them to our side with our sugarless gluten-free wheat germ fritters!","mis_p02_marinsw_012_visitsundale_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Good luck with that.  Later, hippies.","mis_p02_marinsw_012_visitsundale_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Wait! You forgot your brown rice cream with unsweetened carob!","mis_p02_marinsw_013_visitskarburough_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Well, if it isn't Lieutenant Morgan! I promise we don't have a crisis on our hands that I haven't told you about...","mis_p02_marinsw_013_visitskarburough_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Glad to hear that, Sheriff. But I'm actually here on other business.  Have you seen any trace of the Silver Wolves in the area lately?","mis_p02_marinsw_013_visitskarburough_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Nope, can't say I have, and I've been keeping a sharp eye out. Is there a problem I should know about?","mis_p02_marinsw_013_visitskarburough_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Not yet, Sheriff, but I'll keep you informed.  C'mon, men, let's look somewhere else.","mis_p02_marinsw_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, men, I don't think I have to tell you what to do. Just go out there and do what you do best: wreak widespread mayhem on a massive scale!","mis_p02_marinsw_020_fightwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Lieutenant, we're trained professionals.

They're being led by that Doug guy.","mis_p02_marinsw_020_fightwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"\"Doug.\" That name sounds more like the kindly old shopkeeper who wears cardigans and gives you free candy, not a six and a half foot tall killing machine with a badass scar.","mis_p02_marinsw_020_fightwolves_enc1_name":"Silver Wolf Invaders","mis_p02_marinsw_030_fightdoug_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I don't know how you found us, but I'm not gonna let this slide!

I'll just have Perkins plant and harvest them.","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_20hint_0_body_0":"Peppers are actually a type of berry.","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_60reward_0_body_0":"Aaand it's circling right back to funny again.","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I dunno, these peppers don't look so OH MY GOD MY EYES IT'S LIKE THERE'S A FLAME TANK RAMPAGING IN MY SKULL!!!","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Perkins, be careful! You'll drop the bushel! I warned you about wearing gloves!","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Okay, watching Perkins writhe in agony is starting to get boring, and I think I almost feel sorry for him. What can we do?","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Not much, unless there's a vat of milk we can stick his head in.  He'll just have to wash his eyes out and hope for the best.","mis_p02_pepper_010_growpeppers_70enddialog_4_title_0":"I DIDN'T KNOW THIS KIND OF AGONY EXISTED! GOD HELP ME, I DIDN'T KNOW!!!","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You might be onto something with these peppers, Floyd. Perkins almost clawed his face off!","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, we can't just use whole peppers. We'll need to process them into powder to coat the crops. That'll give the boars quite a shock!","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Or just cook 'em from the inside out. I'd make Perkins do the processing...","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Mommy?  Mommy? Do I have to go to school, Mommy?","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_10startdialog_4_body_0":"... but I think he's still too traumatized to be useful.  I'll just have them refined at the Machine Shop. They have the equipment and protective gear to handle even those peppers.","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm only three and a half years old!","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_60reward_0_body_0":"I'll yell at Floyd once my heart starts again...","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This is it! A vial of pure concentrated Death Pepper essence in powder form!","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Ah, Floyd... Can you not wave it around like that? You're making me nervous.","mis_p02_pepper_020_grindpeppers_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, please! I'm a trained Scientist! If I can handle chemical weapons, I can handle- Oops, almost dropped it there. My apologies.","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So now that we have your... Powder of Doom, what do we do with it?","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_10startdialog_1_body_0":"The most efficient delivery method would be to dissolve the powder in water and set up a series of sprinklers to spread it over Sundale's fields in aerosol form.","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Just to ask... what exactly will this do to their crops?","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, only make them a little spicier. I've already sent over my patented antacids.","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Okay, fine, but if this ends up creating boars that breathe fire, YOU'RE the one who's going to have to handle them.","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_20hint_0_body_0":"Morgan just doesn't seem to trust Science!","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_60reward_0_body_0":"Floyd's got a funny definition of \"unqualified\"...","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, we put in the sprinklers... after a town hall meeting followed by a community vote, of course...","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes? And? It worked, didn't it?","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, yeah, man, it sure did! The boars took one whiff and headed for the hills!  We're also kinda crying all the time from our mouths burning like a hot asphalt road in the middle of summer, but at least we got food, man!","mis_p02_pepper_030_buildsprinklers_70enddialog_3_body_0":"An unqualified success! Science triumphs once again!","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Come, come! There's not a second to waste!","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Perkins, my boy!","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Gee, I don't know, Percival. I have to finish polishing Lieutenant Morgan's golf clubs...","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh, hang the Lieutenant's golf clubs! This is more important! Adventure awaits! There's an Ancient ruin to the northwest that I've long wanted to explore, and you're just the man I'd want by my side!","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That sounds... really neat. I guess the golf clubs can wait...","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Of course they can! But first things first: we must be properly outfitted! No sense going there without being prepared.","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_20hint_0_body_0":"If Perkins does a good job on these clubs, I'll let him polish the real ones.","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_60reward_0_body_0":"Percival sure knows how to motivate people...","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Capital! I hope you're ready for quite the adventure, Perkins! It's a long walk to Sector 8...","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up just a second! Did I just hear you say \"Sector 8\"? The Empire has specifically forbidden travel there!","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, the Empire isn't in much position to stop me anymore, is it, Lieutenant? Now come along, Perkins! Fortune favors the bold!","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh, no you don't! I didn't authorize Perkins to\u2014","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Hundred year old brandy.","mis_p02_percperk2_010_makeequipment_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Have a good trip, you two.","mis_p02_percperk2_020_traveltolab_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We all packed? Good! Great discoveries and greater peril await us!","mis_p02_percperk2_020_traveltolab_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That sounds good! Well, half good, anyway.","mis_p02_percperk2_020_traveltolab_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, come now! Nothing like a good stare at death to get the blood flowing!","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Man... Look at this place...","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Incredible! See that? That's a photonic refiner! It was used to convert light into energy! And there! An ionic cyclotron! So many fascinating experiments conducted with those!","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wow, you sure know a lot about this Ancient tech stuff...","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"But of course. Any good explorer must do their research. Ah! That one there was a magnetic field generator! And that over there, of course, is a group of Silver Wolves scavenging for parts.","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_10startdialog_4_body_0":"So what's the thing with the two\u2014 Wait, what was that last part again?","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"Bah, like those fools could understand the wonders they're ripping apart.","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"Heck, I think this place is probably safer!","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Serves them right, meddling with forces they can barely comprehend! Why, if they'd finished removing that tungsten fusion battery, they would've blown half this region to smithereens!","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Really?! So, uh... Will we be okay?","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Naturally! I'm here, after all. Just... don't touch anything. It's better if you don't know what could happen if you were to bump against the wrong button.","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Don't worry; I know the drill. I've been in Zoey's workshop.","mis_p02_percperk2_025_silverwolves_enc1_name":"Silver Wolf Scavengers","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Look, over there! An Ancient vault! The researchers would use them to store and protect their most valuable creations and finds!","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_1_body_0":"How do you know so much about all this Ancient ruin stuff, anyway?","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I, er... borrowed some classified Imperial archaeological reports. Please don't tell your Lieutenant this. Ah! We're here!","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hmm, looks like this one's not locked. This should be\u2014","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_4_body_0":"That was close; you almost activated the automatic defenses! They would have sliced you into microparticles in moments!","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_4_title_0":"PERKINS! Don't take another step!","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_5_body_0":"I... Gulp! Thanks for the warning! But how do we get past them?","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_10startdialog_6_body_0":"Now that's a bit of a sticky problem. We'd need protection as thick as a concrete wall. Yet to reach the vault itself, that protection would have to move with us! Where on earth would we find something like that?","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_20hint_0_body_0":"Ah. How... resourceful of you all.","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_60reward_0_body_0":"There used to be taxes, but with the Empire gone, well...","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Excellent! Now we can follow the wall to the vault! Walk behind it... Keep up, now! Drop too far behind, and you'll certainly regret it!","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Wow, the wall's taking a beating! What kind of weapons are these?","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, the usual assortment: sonic bullets, lasers, particle beams, pico-missiles... Hopefully, the wall will be able to take the damage.","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Hopefully...?","mis_p02_percperk2_030_makewall_70enddialog_4_body_0":"This is life, Perkins! There are no guarantees! If you want certainties, death is the only one, and some even question that! So buck up, lad!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The vault! Finally! We're a hair's breadth from success now, Perkins!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Uh, it sort of looks like the last vault we opened. I hope it has something better in it this time...","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_2_body_0":"One must have confidence and optimism, Perkins! If I didn't, I would never have the long, illustrious career I have now! Just let me get the door, and... Ah!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Oh, I know it does!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_3_body_0":"What do you see? What's inside?","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_4_body_0":"And sandworms. It seems they turned the vault into a nest... And now they see us. Hrm, they don't look happy. Not at all.","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_10startdialog_4_title_0":"Spiderwasps, actually.","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_20hint_0_body_0":"Never a moment's rest, eh, Perkins? But that's what makes life interesting!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_60reward_0_body_0":"Oh, Perkins! Those golf clubs aren't polishing themselves!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Finally! Now we're in! Hopefully those beasts didn't break everything...","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Hey, what's that red glow? It's coming from that box...","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Why, it's...! Hmmm. But it's not... Oh! That must be because...","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_2_title_0":"Red glow?! Let me see that!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I don't see anything else here. I hope you're not too disappointed, Percival...","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_4_body_0":"THIS makes the entire trip worthwhile! Oh, Perkins, if only you knew the kind of power that rests in this box!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_4_title_0":"Disappointed? Far from it!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Really? What is it? What's it do?","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_70enddialog_6_body_0":"Hmm? Oh, I... I couldn't say without a great deal more research. Ah, I apologize, my boy, but I must be off. Thank you for aiding my little endeavor! Until next time and next adventure, Perkins!","mis_p02_percperk2_040_fightcritters_enc1_name":"Vault Critters","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Not that we're not grateful for everything you've done for us, Lieutenant...","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Fine, fine, we'll start repairing all the buildings tomorrow.  I'll have Perkins spread mammoth patties for the flower beds...","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No no! I actually wanted something different. See, we can't always be callin' on you to defend us every time we get attacked, so I was wonderin' what you'd suggest to help us stand on our own two feet.","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_10startdialog_3_body_0":"... Really?  You mean if I tell you what to do,  you'll actually LISTEN? And without whining or arguing?","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Of course! Why not? You're a lieutenant in the Imperial Army, after all. You don't get there by bein' a dummy.","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_10startdialog_5_body_0":"No! No, you don't... All right, then, Judge, my opinion: first you have to train your citizens to defend themselves.  Perhaps if you watch how we train our troops...","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_20hint_0_body_0":"Hey, Judge, want to practice cracking the whip for a while?","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_60reward_0_body_0":"Finally, the respect I deserve.","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I have to admit, these matters are not my area of expertise, but you Imperials seem to have the training regimen down pat!","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We have to! We go through a lot of troops.","mis_p02_pierc_010_helptrainmilita_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, regardless, my militia captains will be putting your methods into practice at once!  Bernmoth is a whole lot safer now, thanks to y'all!","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_10startdialog_0_body_0":"If you don't mind me saying this, Judge... You're treating us a lot better than Ma.","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ma may like you, or she may not. But she sure as shootin' doesn't trust ya.  You don't get to be her age and build a business empire like hers by trustin' blindly.","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, then, I'm glad that you, at least, are so gracious.","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's just the way I was raised, son. I give credit where credit is due. Anyhow, what's the next step?","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Vehicles. Against the Silver Wolves, infantry may not be enough. Not that you need tanks or anything, but at least some scout bikes will help a lot...","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Actually, I'm ahead of you there. We were startin' to build a Vehicle Factory when the riots started.  All we need from you is a little push to help finish up.","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_20hint_0_body_0":"I'd get Zoey to help, but I think the judge wants his factory intact.","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_60reward_0_body_0":"Me? No, I'm not laughin'\u2026 Just\u2026 clearin' my throat!","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, now, ain't that a sight? Not only will we get vehicles to help in our defense, but we can build trucks for farmin', and provide jobs to boot!","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yep, there's nothing like the military-industrial complex to advance civilization!","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Y'know, bein' part of the Empire was fine and all... We paid our taxes and got our supplies... But we never got the feelin' anyone CARED. Y'all are the first to actually care about us in a long spell.","mis_p02_pierc_020_helpbuildvehfactory_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well! Ah... We rugged, masculine frontier types have to stick together, don't we?","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_10startdialog_0_body_0":"What's the next step for the Bernmoth Defense Militia, Lieutenant? We are completely in your capable hands!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Kind of you, Judge... Anyway, I'd like to see what kind of progress your militia is making in their training...","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_10startdialog_2_body_0":"How about a little sparrin' practice? And heck, why not add a little wager? Whoever wins more battles gets his men treated to a rip roarin' barbeque by the losers!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_10startdialog_3_body_0":"You're on!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Excellent! I'll send the troops on down.  You engage 'em whenever you're ready.  I'll make sure they don't hold back, so make sure you don't either!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_20hint_0_body_0":"You men had better not embarrass me or the Empire out there!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_60reward_0_body_0":"Help... Choking... on... delicious... barbecue...","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wow, look at this spread! I haven't seen this much food since my visits to Grandma's!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, your lieutenant and I made a little bet, and I lost, fair and square.  Eat up, folks!","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, GOD, this chow is good. You're a very gracious loser, Judge...","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well, the way I see it, we gotta stick together, or we ain't gonna survive.  It's pretty much law in these parts, and I don't see any reason to change it for you folks...","mis_p02_pierc_030_practicemilita_70enddialog_4_body_0":"I'm sure the Lieutenant will thank you, Judge, if he ever actually takes a moment between swallows to breathe...","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sirs, after those riots, I got to thinking. If we're going to deal with civilians, we should probably consider training some people in non-lethal methods of crowd control.","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Sir, Perkins is making a pretty good point here.","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Ramsey, this is a reasonable plan, but I'd like YOU to explain it to me, so I can pretend that it wasn't Perkins' idea.","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Soldiers are trained to kill people. Since we're dealing with civilians, we need to train some soldiers to not kill people.","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_10startdialog_4_title_0":"Perfect.","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_20hint_0_body_0":"He called me reasonable!","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_60reward_0_body_0":"Help!","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I had the Peace Keepers practice on Perkins! It's hilarious!","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Hahaha! Look!","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sir, is that really appropriate?","mis_p02_pkeep_010_trainpeacekeepers_70enddialog_2_body_0":"He can't get out of the net, Ramsey! HE CAN'T GET OUT OF THE NET!","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, I have some concerns about the Peace Keepers.","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We never should have listened to Perkins!","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_10startdialog_1_title_0":"I knew it!","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No, that's not it. The troops are fine, but without any lethal options, they feel a little naked out there.","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_10startdialog_2_body_1":"Why not give them some support? Maybe a Riot Truck?","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I continue to support this initiative whenever you're the one who explains it to me.","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_20hint_0_body_0":"We used a Riot Truck to gas hippies at the Academy.","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_60reward_0_body_0":"And I'm no jerk!","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Yup, it totally worked. As long as Morgan thinks it's my idea, he'll pay attention.","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Thanks for helping out, Sarge. It's nice to know I can help. You know, as long as I accept that I'll never receive any credit or respect.","mis_p02_pkeep_020_trainriottruck_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Respect is for jerks, kid.","mis_p02_pkeep_030_masriots_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We've got more food riots, this time in Trotbeck!","mis_p02_pkeep_030_masriots_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Sir!","mis_p02_pkeep_030_masriots_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Wait a second.

I'm in a bit of a bind, and I was hoping you folks would be willing to help out.","mis_p02_riots_010_nonlethalforce_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, if you need to blow stuff up, we're certainly experts at that...","mis_p02_riots_010_nonlethalforce_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Quite the opposite, actually.  Times are tough with the Empire's... troubles.  Supplies are running low, and, well, the people are starting to get riled up.  They're out breaking windows and burning buildings and such.","mis_p02_riots_010_nonlethalforce_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wait, Bernmoth is spiralling into civil unrest and you call that \"a bit of a bind\"? Are all you frontier people so... understated?","mis_p02_riots_010_nonlethalforce_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well, they're good people.  They're just hurtin'.  But they still need to be stopped before someone gets hurt.  If you could find your way to Bernmoth sometime, I'd sure appreciate it.","mis_p02_riots_010_nonlethalforce_20hint_0_body_0":"I'd hate to see the kind of situation that would make the judge actually panic.","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Whew, this place is a mess!  Okay, spread out and take down those rioters!","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Uh, sir? It's one thing to shoot down Rebels and Silver Wolves, but these people are just angry civilians...","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I know they're not soldiers, Ramsey. They're rednecks. Take out their trucks, and they'll run home cryin'.","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_10startdialog_3_title_0":"Seems kinda mean.","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_20hint_0_body_0":"Try to shoot gently, I guess.","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_60reward_0_body_0":"When did I become a Frontier Cop?","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Hmm, this place is a lot more peaceful once you get rid of the burning oil drums and pitchfork-waving mobs.","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That it is. Things are a lot calmer here, thanks to you all.","mis_p02_riots_011_nonlethalforce1_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wow... Being gratefully praised for doing the right thing...  I could get used to this!","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Bernmoth isn't out of the woods yet.  There'll be more riots unless we do something.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You were right about one thing: between the Empire's fall and the riots, you don't look in much condition to get the store shelves full anytime soon.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm afraid I have to ask for your help again. We have a lot of wheat in our food stores, but we need more meat.  We also gotta get tools to start rebuilding, and the right protective gear so the workers don't get hurt.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sounds like something we can help with.  Luckily for you, we're in the process of learning to solve more problems than we cause.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_20hint_0_body_0":"We're running out of a lot of things, but I won't need much to calm things down a tad.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_60reward_0_body_0":"Everything's better with meat and violence.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_70enddialog_0_body_0":"That was quick work!  I think that's just about all we need! Should be a lot quieter from here on in.","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yup, stuff like this reaches into the primal heart of humanity: the part that still wants to rip animals apart with their bare teeth and bash in everything that stands in their way!","mis_p02_riots_020_helpmapierce_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Uh... Sure, right. No offense, Sergeant, but... when was the last time you had a vacation?","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_10startdialog_0_body_0":"If it isn't Elder Taos! Long time no see! How is the mantle of leadership feeling? Heavy?","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_10startdialog_1_body_0":"With great power comes great responsibility. Where old difficulties are conquered, new challenges arise from the ashes.  It is with us as I am sure it is with you.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Uh oh... What's the matter?","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_10startdialog_3_body_0":"With Gantas fallen, many who were once under his protection have fled to my lands.  They need much, but most of all shelter. My people are too occupied trying to feed and protect them to secure materials to make more tents.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I suppose since your situation is KIND OF our fault, we can help you out. We're generous that way.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_20hint_0_body_0":"They use the oil to waterproof hides.  Kind of gross, but it's not like they can farm plastic.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm suddenly REALLY glad we never made him mad...","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_0_body_0":"No longer will the wind and rain depress the already downtrodden spirits of those who seek shelter with us.  We accept these with gratitude.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We'll just send these up by supply truck.  It'll be faster than you having to carry them up there.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Ah, if only I were still in my youth. I remember the days when I would carry entire mammoths on my back for my tribe's nightly meals.","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Really?","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_3_body_1":"You...?","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_3_body_2":"I mean...","mis_p02_riots_030_turninsupplies_70enddialog_3_body_3":"I'm not saying that I don't believe you, but... whole mammoths?  Whoa...","mis_p02_riots_nonlethalforce_enc_name":"Angry Civilians","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins!

I have so much to live for...","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_10startdialog_2_body_0":"My shower isn't draining fast enough. You know how uncomfortable it is to stand in ankle-deep water while you're trying to scrub your armpits?","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I can't say I do, sir; I haven't had a hot shower in two weeks.","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You smell like it, too. And you call yourself an Imperial soldier!  Anyway, do whatever you have to do to get my shower running again.  Oh, and I better not catch you actually using it, or there'll be hell to pay!","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_20hint_0_body_0":"Should I worry that the Distillery can make drain cleaner?","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_60reward_0_body_0":"Arrgh! Caught!","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Sir... I poured the strongest drain cleaner the Distillery could make down the shower drain. It didn't work.","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_70enddialog_1_body_0":"The Distillery can make drain cleaner...?  Huh. Anyway, I'm displeased to hear about your failure. I'm sure it's your fault somehow.","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Of course, sir.","mis_p02_shower_010_makedrainx_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Obviously, this will require backbreaking and completely unrewarding manual labor. I'm sure you... Perkins! Were you trying to sneak away? Ten demerits for insubordination!","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So what you're saying is, after taking apart the plumbing and putting it back together FOUR times on my orders, you STILL haven't figured out the problem with my shower?","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Not yet, sir.  Do I need to go for number five?","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No, this obviously isn't working. So we'll have to take a drastic and nauseating step.  And by 'we,' obviously, I mean 'you.'","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Yes, sir\u2026?","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You'll have to go down into the sewers and clear out the blockage. Talk to Floyd about making you a suit. I won't have you smelling up this outpost any more than you already have.","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_20hint_0_body_0":"This is going to stink, isn't it?","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_60reward_0_body_0":"*sigh* I'll go get my rifle...","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perkins? Finally, you're...  PERKINS! You're dripping sewage all over my area rug! You're cleaning that up, mister!","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Rats!","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Now, now, Specialist, Imperial troops approach their duties with cheerfulness and aplomb! Do you want to go through my special morale training again?","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_70enddialog_3_body_0":"No, sir, actual rats! In the sewer! They're all over the place! There are so many, they were clogging up the pipes! That's what was causing the clog!","mis_p02_shower_020_makedivingsuit_70enddialog_4_body_0":"That's hideous and repulsive.  I don't envy the poor sap who has to go down there and take care of the problem.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I don't suppose Mr. Purrface could do this, could he? He was pretty good at dealing with rats before...","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Mr. Purrface is... unavailable right now. Ramsey said something about \"sunbeam time.\"  Anyway, I took the initiative and flushed, just, a TON of bleach down the drain to drive out the rats.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Uh, sir... Is that safe?","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hell, no! But it worked! They were driven right out of the sewers and the pipes... but now they're running rampant across the whole outpost. I pity the poor sap who has to wade through that tide of vermin.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_10startdialog_3_body_1":"Welp, good luck, Perkins. Don't come back until you've cleared them all out.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Yes, sir.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_20hint_0_body_0":"I can't believe Mr. Purrface is treated better than I am!","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_60reward_0_body_0":"Join the army, they said.  See the world, they said...","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ahhh, a nice hot shower, and no standing water to bring down the experience! I am fully relaxed and satisfied now!","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I'm very happy for you, sir.  Reporting in: all the rats are gone now.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Go take a shower!  Hell, take fifty!  Oh, but you won't have any hot water because I just used it all, so just soak in ice-cold water until you don't smell.  Or you pass out.  Either way, at least you won't be here, stinking up the place.","mis_p02_shower_030_fightrats_70enddialog_2_title_0":"Perkins! You reek of sweat and rat!","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Is there a Lieutenant Morgan around?

He told me if I needed anything, that I could ask Lieutenant Morgan - that the Lieutenant was a good man.","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_10startdialog_2_title_0":"He was my grandpa.","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Your grandfather was always kinder to me than I deserved. What can I do for you?","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well, the town where I work, we're having some problems\u2014","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Grab your gear, folks. If this guy's gift for understatement is anything like his grandfather's, we've got no time to lose.","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_20hint_0_body_0":"I won't have another Bernmoth.","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_60reward_0_body_0":"Wait, Ma Pierce is rich?","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I've got to admit, I was expecting something a little more bucolic.","mis_p02_skar_010_gotoskarborough_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I know she ain't much to look at, but Skarborough was a pretty major exporter of steel and iron for the Empire. Stock in these mines is a big part of what made Ma as rich as she is.","mis_p02_skar_020_savehostages_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, what are we looking at? Silver Wolves? Riots?","mis_p02_skar_020_savehostages_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Both. The Silver Wolves want Skarborough's steel, so they're trying to rile folks up and run me out. Right now they're blocking access to the mines, but they're doing it with locals they paid off to act as human shields.","mis_p02_skar_020_savehostages_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Got it; we'll use the kid gloves on this one.","mis_p02_skar_020_savehostages_20hint_0_body_0":"By kid gloves, I mean firehose.","mis_p02_skar_020_savehostages_60reward_0_body_0":"It's nice to be wanted.","mis_p02_skar_020_savehostages_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I can't thank you folks enough. My grip on things out here is pretty loose as it is. Knowing I've got you folks on my side is going to help more than you can imagine.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Now we've got Silver Wolves setting up shop on the outskirts of town.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Damn, I knew that was too easy.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Don't worry about it, kid. If you think we're good with unruly mobs, wait till you see how we handle a real threat.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's clean this place up.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_60reward_0_body_0":"I can't let this kid down.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Lieutenant, I can't thank you enough. I'll do my best not to bother you in the future.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Don't you dare. This is a one industry town, and you just lost your only customer. You folks are looking at bumpy times, and I want to know about it BEFORE things go south.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, Grampa sure was right about you.","mis_p02_skar_030_defeatsilverwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I wish that was true. I'm working on it.","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sheriff Pierce! How're things at Skarborough?","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ah, well, can't complain.  Could be better, though.","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Oh, god, what's the major catastrophe that's come up?","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_10startdialog_3_body_0":"It's nothing, really.  It's just... we're a little short on food, with the Silver Wolves squeezing us and there being no Empire to buy iron anymore.  The people are hungry, and, well, hungry people get riled up...","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Ah, food riots.  Always a fun time.  Get the men, Ramsey; we've got an uprising to crush.","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm getting the strangest sense of deja vu.","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_60reward_0_body_0":"I think I got the Lieutenant a tad upset...","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, would you look at that? Skarborough is almost peaceful now! The people owe you, Lieutenant, and so do I!","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_70enddialog_1_body_0":"It's the least I can do, Sheriff.  Your grandpa was a fine man.  But next time, maybe you could, I don't know, TELL us when your town's teetering on the edge of complete societal collapse.","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I didn't want to be a bother...","mis_p02_skar_040_capturerioters_70enddialog_3_body_0":"A bother?! Holy hell, is Ma the only one in your family with any sense of self-preservation?! I want you to promise - promise! - you'll come to us the next time you have problems!","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_10startdialog_0_body_0":"As grateful as I am, Lieutenant, this ain't over, not by a long shot.  If I can't make sure that the people are fed, I don't think I can keep the peace for very long.","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, our Outpost is in a slightly better position to produce food. We can tide you over until we can figure out how to get your economy going again.","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That sounds great, but I don't want to be any troub\u2013","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_10startdialog_3_body_0":"If you don't accept our help graciously, I will have someone stab you. For real.","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I'll gladly accept your help, thanks!","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_20hint_0_body_0":"When in doubt, threaten a stabbing!","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_60reward_0_body_0":"Mmmm... Barbecue...","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This is more than generous, Lieutenant!  I oughta be able to maintain order for at least a little while longer!","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_70enddialog_1_body_0":"This isn't a permanent solution, but it'll buy us some time to find one.","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_70enddialog_2_body_0":"When this is over, I'm gonna treat y'all to a barbecue! I have my grandpa's recipe for spicy raptor ribs, and\u2013 Oh, my, what was that hideous sound? It was like a hundred boars grunting all at once!","mis_p02_skar_041_makefood_70enddialog_3_body_0":"That was my stomach.  Sorry.","mis_p02_skar_050_helpsundale_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Looks like the Silver Wolves are acting up again.  They seem to be concentrating on the area around Sundale.","mis_p02_skar_050_helpsundale_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Then that's where we're headed.  Whatever they're doing there, it can't be good.","mis_p02_skar_050_helpsundale_20hint_0_body_0":"I'm getting tired of putting out Wolf-related fires.","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hail, visitors!

We're here to help you out with the Silver Wolves.","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, we don't, you know, while my role as foreperson does give me certain responsibilities, there's not like... authority isn't something you can HAVE, it's something people let you use.","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Are you high?! Look, hippy, do you want an autocratic military dictatorship to get these Silver Wolves off your back so you can get back to following your bliss?","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Yes, please.","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_20hint_0_body_0":"While we're at it, they could probably use help in farming...","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_60reward_0_body_0":"I love it when problems solve themselves.","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The Silver Wolves are gone?!

See, man, everything works out in the end!","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, if you get someone else to do all your work.  If you're just going to sit around and let us do the heavy lifting, then maybe we should\u2014","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Hold on, Morgan, I have an idea.  Mr. Jonsey, you must need a lot of iron to keep your farm equipment and machinery in top shape, don't you?","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Sure do, man.  Why?","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Well, there's a town called Skarborough that has a lot of iron to sell, and is in desperate need of food...","mis_p02_skar_051_helpsundale_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Yeah... yeah! I see what you're getting at, dude!  Send 'em over! We'd be totally stoked to work out some kind of mutually beneficial gift and barter economy!","mis_p02_skarriots_010_stopriots1_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Is that Sheriff Pierce's truck coming up, sir?","mis_p02_skarriots_010_stopriots1_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Quiet, Perkins. I have a head\u2014","mis_p02_skarriots_010_stopriots1_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Rally the troops! We have trouble in Skarborough! What's going on, Sheriff? Sandworms? Silver Wolves? Some other terrible invasion?","mis_p02_skarriots_010_stopriots1_10startdialog_1_title_1":"I mean, sound the alarm!","mis_p02_skarriots_010_stopriots1_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No, nothing like that, Lieutenant Morgan.

So, Sheriff, what major crisis will we be resolving today?","mis_p02_skarsand_010_defeatsandworms_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Sandworms, Lieutenant.","mis_p02_skarsand_010_defeatsandworms_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Say no more.  I'm proud of you for actually asking me for help before Skarborough gets flattened.

Y'all are becoming this little town's guardian angel!","mis_p02_skarsand_010_defeatsandworms_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wow, that's the first time anyone's ever called me their angel... I could get used to this!","mis_p02_skarsand_010_defeatsandworms_enc1_name":"Sandworm Infestation","mis_p02_skarsand_020_makeparty_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Say, Sheriff, Sandworms are attracted by fear. Has Skarborough been particularly... afraid lately?","mis_p02_skarsand_020_makeparty_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, we're a pretty laid back town, Lieutenant. But what with the Silver Wolves and the riots and the food shortages...","mis_p02_skarsand_020_makeparty_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We need to get town morale back up, or the Sandworms could return.

What's he doing here?","mis_p02_skarsand_020_makeparty_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Either he wants to join in on the festivities, or he's bringing dire news of a great peril that's probably our fault.

And you did not bury their corpses at least eight feet underground with a mixture of ceremonial herbs?","mis_p02_skarsand_030_defeatelder_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wait, we were supposed to do that? We've killed dozens of Sandworms already and nothing happened!","mis_p02_skarsand_030_defeatelder_10startdialog_4_body_0":"That is because the Elder Sandworm was not then stirring in its slumber, the death of its warren-mates calling out for vengeance.","mis_p02_skarsand_030_defeatelder_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Elder Sandworm...  Let me guess: it's strong, huge, and hostile.","mis_p02_skarsand_030_defeatelder_10startdialog_6_body_0":"Extremely hostile, actually.","mis_p02_skarsand_030_defeatelder_10startdialog_7_title_0":"Swell.","mis_p02_skarsand_030_defeatelder_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, yes, and hungry.

But no.  They're acting... creepy, actually. Their forces have moved into spitting distance of several frontier towns, but they're not doing anything.  Just sitting there.","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wait, silent intimidation tactics?  They can do something other than just loot and pillage?","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I'm as surprised as you are.  Still, as long as they're there, they could DO something at any moment.  They need to go.","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_20hint_0_body_0":"I'd rather be hunting Rebels, but these jokers are almost as good.","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_60reward_0_body_0":"Things are already so hairy, it's practically a mammoth.","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Of course, you know that Stephenson isn't gonna be too pleased with us. He can't afford a full-out conflict any more than we can.","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, unless you want to let them plunder wherever they please, it was going to come to that anyway.  His buddy Bronson doesn't strike me as the patient type.","mis_p02_slwlf_020_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_2_body_0":"All I'm saying is that we should be prepared. Things are going to get a lot hairier from here on in.","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Don't look now, Morgan, but we have visitors.","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Welp, time to face the music.  I'm gonna go see them.  You go do what you need to do.","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I am disappointed. I thought you Imperials were more practical than this. Do you not already have your hands full with Rebels and Raiders? Why do you want to fight us? Do you realize how hard you're trying our patience?","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hey, we don't like this any more than you do. But we don't like the whole \"exploiting and looting the weak and helpless\" thing either.  You're the ones who aren't leaving us with a choice.","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You aren't getting our point.  Your forces are making us very... uncomfortable out there.  If you continue, we can make YOUR lives very uncomfortable.","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Oh, uncomfortable?  Why didn't you say so?  I've got just the solution!","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_20hint_0_body_0":"Is Morgan making them SARCASTIC robes?","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_60reward_0_body_0":"Okay, I admit that sounded ominous...","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_70enddialog_0_body_0":"And what... is this?","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, you said you were being made uncomfortable, so I thought I'd fix that! Put your feet up, maybe have a nice glass of cognac...","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Why, you...! I'll give you a scar to match!","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Mmm, very witty.  Are all Silver Wolves as bright and charming as you?","mis_p02_slwlf_030_makesarcasticrobes_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Calm down, Doug.  Don't let them bait you. They don't fully grasp the situation.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We're not the dumb thugs you think we are...","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Are you a different dumb thug than\u2014","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's enough!","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Aww.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_4_body_0":"We anticipated your... intransigence.  So I have sent some of my men to visit the frontier towns you seem so eager to protect.  They've made... friends there.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Our mutual friends are happy and safe... for now.  But should you continue your reckless interference in our affairs, who knows? Maybe they encounter some unfortunate accidents. If they were to be hurt badly... that would be on your head, wouldn't it?","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_6_body_0":"I... see.  Then I guess there's only one thing we can do.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_6_body_1":"Perkins, give the signal.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_10startdialog_7_body_0":"Yes, sir!","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_20hint_0_body_0":"Tell the strike teams to move in!","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_60reward_0_body_0":"And that lesson is: do NOT mess with the Empire.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What... what just happened?","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_70enddialog_1_body_0":"See, we anticipated your anticipation of our intransigence.  So we hid forces in the towns, and just waited.  When your men popped up, we were ready.  Not quite fast enough to keep you from your hostages, but fast enough to put you down like dogs.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We seem to have underestimated you. We won't make that mistake again.  Mark my words, Imperials, this isn't over.","mis_p02_slwlf_040_savefrontierhostages_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well, you apparently haven't learned your lesson, so I guess not.","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, Morgan, I've been thinking\u2014","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh hell. Who do we shoot this time?","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, see, that's it exactly. It seems like we're often waiting around here, only hearing about problems when it's already too late. I think we'd win a lot of hearts and minds if we were seen as proactive.","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_10startdialog_3_body_0":"So what do you suggest? We go out, patrol the world map, and improve our reputation by attacking Silver Wolves before they cause much damage? We win friends by shooting enemies?","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Yes, basically.","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_10startdialog_5_title_0":"AWESOME.","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_20hint_0_body_0":"Sergeant! Don't sneak up on me like that!","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_60reward_0_body_0":"Sarcasm is mockery using irony. Why?","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Why don't you just take my badge while you're at it.","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Thanks for the \"help,\" Morgan.","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_70enddialog_1_body_0":"See, Morgan! You're a man of the people!","mis_p02_slwlf_050_defeatwolvessouthfrontier_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Do you have the slightest idea what sarcasm is?","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, I've just gotten reports that the Silver Wolves are acting strangely.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What, did one of them pay for something?","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Actually, they're fanning out over the heartland, far from most settlements. It's almost like they're looking for something.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Whatever it is, I'm sure we don't want to let them have it.  We need to throw a monkey wrench into their plans.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_20hint_0_body_0":"It's fun to stymie.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_60reward_0_body_0":"Just thinking about reading a Silver Wolf's mind makes me gag.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Welp, whatever their plans were, we sure put a crimp on 'em. Bronson ain't gonna like that.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_1_body_0":"The only question is, what WERE their plans?  I hate to think that they're up to something we have no clue about.","mis_p02_slwlf_060_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Same here, but unless you can read their minds, all we can do for now is keep a closer eye on them.","mis_p02_slwlf_070_defeatwolvesheartland_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, I have a theory about what the Silver Wolves are up to...","mis_p02_slwlf_070_defeatwolvesheartland_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Does it involve hysteria and mindless violence?  That's about par for the course for these goons.","mis_p02_slwlf_070_defeatwolvesheartland_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Actually, if I'm right, it's quite the opposite.  But I need more information.","mis_p02_slwlf_070_defeatwolvesheartland_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Well, our scouts are reporting that they're sniffing around again. Looks like we need to punch them in the nose. Like a shark. But on land. Anyway, let's see if we can't get you your info too.","mis_p02_slwlf_070_defeatwolvesheartland_20hint_0_body_0":"Or the gills? Where DO you punch a land shark?","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You guys keep getting in our way! We don't appreciate that.  Not at all.","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, we don't appreciate all the looting and pillaging, either, but you don't see us whining about it. We just march in and kick ass.","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We're getting tired of you butting in where you don't belong. We gave you a chance.  Maybe you oughta see just how foolish it was to refuse our generous offer.","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_20hint_0_body_0":"I've refused offers much more generous than that!","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_60reward_0_body_0":"Being the monkey wrench plays to our strengths.","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So how was it out there?","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_70enddialog_1_body_0":"The usual.  We sent Doug running home to his boss with his tail between his legs.  Anything new?","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I've been going over your new data, and it's confirmed my theory.  The Silver Wolves are searching for certain rare minerals and ores used in high-level manufacturing.","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Manufacturing of what?","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Circuit boards, processors, and optics.  This particular combination seems familiar, but I can't quite place it right now...","mis_p02_slwlf_071_defeatdoug_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Well, whatever the reason, they'll have a much harder time of it now, thanks to us.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, sir! The Silver Wolves have Installation 17's Chief Administrator captive! He's being held somewhere in the Heartland, but I'm not sure where.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What? How'd you find that out?","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, sir, I saw a few Silver Wolves drinking in Trotbeck, and... I've discovered that people kind of... tend to forget that I'm around.  So they keep on talking.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hm? I'm sorry, I stopped paying attention to you.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Sir, I think I can get more information from these guys if I grease the wheels a little.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_5_body_0":"You want to pay them off?","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_10startdialog_6_body_0":"I want to get them drunk.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_20hint_0_body_0":"Are there any problems alcohol can't solve?","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_60reward_0_body_0":"This is the least I've ever been disappointed in Perkins.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Success, sir! They're holding him at a highway rest stop. They're using the place as a depot.","mis_p02_slwlf_080_makedrink_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Send Ramsey and Cassidy down to scout the place. I want to know what we're up against.","mis_p02_slwlf_090_destroyfortress_10startdialog_0_body_0":"All right, their defenses are heavy, but they're sloppy. If we're careful, we can pick our way through with minimal conflict.","mis_p02_slwlf_090_destroyfortress_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Alternately, we can just destroy everything in our path. You know, your call.","mis_p02_slwlf_090_destroyfortress_20hint_0_body_0":"I mean, I know which one I'D choose.","mis_p02_slwlf_090_destroyfortress_60reward_0_body_0":"Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!","mis_p02_slwlf_090_destroyfortress_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All set. We can move in to retake the prisoner whenever you're ready.","mis_p02_slwlf_090_destroyfortress_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Or we can stay here and you let me finish shooting Silver Wolves. But whatever, you know - you're the captain.","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We're close, sir, but there's... a small hiccup.","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What did you do?","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, it looks like they have more than one prisoner and... we don't know which one is the administrator, or who any of the others are.","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I'm not totally sure how that's your fault, but I'll accept that it is. In the meantime, just rescue everyone, and leave them tied up. We'll sort it out when we get home.","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_20hint_0_body_0":"Save 'em all and let Perkins sort 'em out.","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_60reward_0_body_0":"That guy is just the worst.","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_70enddialog_0_body_0":"That's the Imperial Army I remember! Great work, folks!","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Woo!","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sirs? Shouldn't we get home so I can start, you know, figuring out who all these prisoners are?","mis_p02_slwlf_100_defeatwolvesfinale_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Man, Perkins, you sure know how to ruin a celebration. Let's all do what Specialist Killjoy says. Let's all just go home and get back to work.","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Let her know her problems are over.","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_0_title_0":"All right! Somebody call Aurora!","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Really, Morgan. At best, a specific subset of her problems are over. Still, I'll send a message. She'll be able to\u2014","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Folks, I hate to interrupt, but, well, it seems you've gotten the Silver Wolves mighty upset. And they're... well, they're taking it out on me.","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sheriff! You did it! You asked for help! If I weren't in such a hurry to save your town, I'd hug you!","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_20hint_0_body_0":"But... the prisoners!","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_60reward_0_body_0":"Yeah, I don't care for him.","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You took something from me. That means I take something from you.","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_0_title_0":"See what you did?","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Leave these people out of it. You want us, you come get us.","mis_p02_slwlf_110_defeatwolvesskarborough_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Why would I do that? Why would I attack you at the outpost, when you got all these towns, these soft, white bellies I can slash at. You made yourself weak. I'm gonna show you how weak.","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_10startdialog_0_body_0":"What can we do?","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You can catch them Silver Wolves and make sure they don't do this again.","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Certainly, and Morgan and Ramsey are hard at work on that. Now, myself, Zoey, the other civilians - what can WE do?","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Folks just want to get things fixed up and get back to work.","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_10startdialog_4_body_0":"That I can do.","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_20hint_0_body_0":"But... the prisoners!","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_60reward_0_body_0":"Why do people pose questions they don't want the answer to?","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I don't know what we'd do without y'all lookin' out for us.","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Thanks, folks.","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, you'd likely have been subjugated by the Silver Wolves. They probably would have kept the skilled laborers alive, and some of the families, both for morale and as leverage. Administrative persons such as yourself would likely have been the first to\u2014","mis_p02_slwlf_120_makewoodenpatchkits_70enddialog_2_body_0":"That's, uh, that's plenty of detail, Floyd. Thanks.","mis_p02_slwlf_130_defeatwolvestrotbeck_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, they're moving on Trotbeck.","mis_p02_slwlf_130_defeatwolvestrotbeck_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Then we need to do the same.","mis_p02_slwlf_130_defeatwolvestrotbeck_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's take these suckers down.","mis_p02_slwlf_130_defeatwolvestrotbeck_60reward_0_body_0":"Why is it you boys only stop by when there's barbarians at the gates?","mis_p02_slwlf_130_defeatwolvestrotbeck_70enddialog_0_body_0":"This is the plan? You attack innocent people, we beat your ass, repeat?","mis_p02_slwlf_130_defeatwolvestrotbeck_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You say that like you're in control. You're running, getting tired. You're right where I want you.","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ma, we're here to help. What was damaged by the Silver Wolves?","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, what can we do to help?","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You kids are sweet, but please, let the grownups get work done.","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I wouldn't blow 'em off, Ma. The kids helped build pretty much every tank we've got.","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well, we've got a lot of damaged farming equipment. Why don't you start there?","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_20hint_0_body_0":"No adding rocket launchers to the backhoes, kids!","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_60reward_0_body_0":"That explains the big family.","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, that's excellent work. It's nice to see you haven't let your young ones lollygag around like most mothers do these days.","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Oh, these kids aren't mine. I'm only 22.","mis_p02_slwlf_140_makemetalpatchkits_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, what are you wasting time for! You need to get started!","mis_p02_slwlf_150_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_0_body_0":"We've got them this time, sirs. They're headed for Recoil Ridge!","mis_p02_slwlf_150_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Let's move!","mis_p02_slwlf_150_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_20hint_0_body_0":"They better not touch my orchard.","mis_p02_slwlf_150_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_60reward_0_body_0":"Uh oh?","mis_p02_slwlf_150_defeatwolvesnorthfrontier_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Oh, wow, you just keep getting worse at this.

Are they headed for Sundale?","mis_p02_slwlf_160_defeatwolvesoutpost_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It's the Outpost!

I'm not a fan of the Silver Wolves.","mis_p02_slwlf_160_defeatwolvesoutpost_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, Morgan, now we've got violent animals, hostile Raider factions, rioting civilians, bloodthirsty rebels, AND the Silver Wolves trying to kill us.","mis_p02_slwlf_160_defeatwolvesoutpost_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You forgot that hot dog I almost choked on.","mis_p02_slwlf_160_defeatwolvesoutpost_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Right, hot dogs are also trying to kill us.

We win.","mis_p02_slwlf_170_recoveryoperation_enc1":"Silver Wolves","mis_p02_slwlf_170_recoveryoperation_enc2":"Silver Wolves","mis_p02_slwlf_170_recoveryoperation_enc3":"Silver Wolves","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Is it just me, or has Zoey been acting odd lately?","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_10startdialog_1_body_0":"More so than usual...? I guess she's been kinda secretive...","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that. I'd prefer my subordinates not be allowed to have secrets. Or personal lives. It's bad for operational efficiency. I'm gonna investigate to find out what she's up to.","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sir? That sounds like a massive invasion of her privacy...","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You think so? I mean, I was going to go with minor, but if you think we can do massive... We're gonna need some sweet sneaking outfits.","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_20hint_0_body_0":"I mean... I guess I have always kinda fantasized about being a ninja.","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_60reward_0_body_0":"Perkins...?

Having... trouble... breathing...","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_70enddialog_1_body_0":"What are you talking ab\u2014 Huh, that does look a tad tight.

That's not good...","mis_p02_sneak_010_ninjaoutfits_70enddialog_3_body_1":"You're too colorful; that defeats the whole purpose of the ninja costumes to begin with! Zoey will see you for sure!

Wonder what she wants here...","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_10startdialog_1_body_0":"It looks like she's examining some of the old devices.","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Hmm, so maybe if I reverse the polarity of the neutron flow, that'll... Oops!","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, man, I hate it when she says that.","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_10startdialog_4_body_0":"She's leaving, sir. Should we follow?","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Of course we should. Oh, unless we're slaughtered by the hostile critters that just popped up behind us.","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's take care of them quick, before Zoey escapes.","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_60reward_0_body_0":"He has a point.","mis_p02_sneak_025_fightcritters_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Bigfoots and spiderwasps fighting *together*?

Which way did she go?","mis_p02_sneak_035_fightraiders_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I apologize, but I cannot answer. We are in the midst of one of our most important festivals.

There she is!","mis_p02_sneak_040_fightdefenses_10startdialog_2_body_0":"She's setting up something... Now she's walking off. Quick, Perkins, this may be our chance!

Everything is so jumbled right now, I have no idea what the chain of command is like in the rest of the Empire.","mis_p02_south_010_gosouth_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Count on it, Floyd. Let's roll out, folks. The Empire needs us.","mis_p02_south_010_gosouth_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's teach these Rebels a lesson!","mis_p02_south_010_gosouth_30advice_0_body_0":"Let's head to the Southern Frontier! Look for the signpost.","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_10startdialog_0_body_0":"The last SOS we received gave these coordinates. Scouts are reporting Rebel troops in the area.","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Perfect. Let's get in there and show them what happens when the Empire has the element of surprise!","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_20hint_0_body_0":"Let's teach these Rebels a lesson!","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_60reward_0_body_0":"Our Imperial brothers need us!","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Damn, whoever sent that SOS is long gone. We're too late.","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_70enddialog_1_body_0":"It looks like the real battle here ended over a week ago. Most of the Rebels soldiers have already moved on to the southeast. These guys were just staying behind to clean up.","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Were you able to get anything relevant from their intel?","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well, it's all a little out of date, but yeah, we've got coordinates of some other Imperial strongholds we can head for.","mis_p02_south_011_gosouth_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Then what are we doin' here talkin'? Let's grab our gear and get moving!","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I see plenty of Rebel activity, sir, but there's no sign of Imperial troops.","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_10startdialog_1_body_0":"They might be holed up nearby or being held prisoner. Either way, the longer we wait, the worse things get for them.","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_20hint_0_body_0":"We have to give it everything we've got!","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_60reward_0_body_0":"We can't be late again!","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_70enddialog_0_body_0":"No sign of survivors, sir. If they did take prisoners, they've already moved them out.","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Give me some good news, Perkins.","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, we've been picking up some Rebel radio chatter. They claim to have Imperial troops pinned down not far from here.","mis_p02_south_020_gosouth_70enddialog_3_title_0":"Why the hell aren't we moving?","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Bingo! We've got action, men!","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_10startdialog_1_body_0":"According to the scouts, the Imperial forces are pinned down in the center of town. The Rebels have them surrounded, but it looks like they aren't expecting reinforcements.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Okay, we'll enter the town and make our approach using the buildings as cover. Once we're in range, our troops will open fire from an encircling position, and our fast, mobile units will remain in reserve to chase down any survivors.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_10startdialog_3_title_0":"Let's crush these Rebels.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_20hint_0_body_0":"Come on, we can do this!","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_60reward_0_body_0":"This can't be everyone. There's no way it's over.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The survivors have joined up with us, sir.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Great! What division are these guys from? Where do we move next?","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Uh, no division, Sergeant. We're from all over. This was kind of the last stand...","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_3_body_0":"What do you mean?","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_4_body_0":"I mean, we're it. Everyone else is either dead or taken prisoner. Apparently, the rebels have so many POWs, when someone tries to surrender, they're just executing them on the spot. The western front is lost.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_5_body_0":"I'm sure you boys made a valiant stand, but there's no way this was the last of the 3rd Corps.","mis_p02_south_030_rescuetroops_70enddialog_6_body_0":"Ramsey is right.","mis_p02_south_040_rebelcamps_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hit and run, boys. There are a lot of Rebel troops scattered to the south of us, and we're going to use their intel to track down the Imperial Army.","mis_p02_south_040_rebelcamps_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We'll strike fast, get what we want, and move out. The Rebels have to know where the rest of the 3rd Corps are, so we'll just keep beating them until they tell us.","mis_p02_south_040_rebelcamps_20hint_0_body_0":"No time to waste!","mis_p02_south_040_rebelcamps_60reward_0_body_0":"Ramsey is right. There's no way it's already over.","mis_p02_south_041_rebelcamps1_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I'm not finding anything about troop locations. The Rebels have orders to move east, and reinforce the divisions that are already fighting the Imperial 2nd and 5th Corps in the southeast.","mis_p02_south_041_rebelcamps1_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Damn, the Rebellion must feel pretty sure about the western front to be pulling troops out.","mis_p02_south_042_rebelcamps2_70enddialog_0_body_0":"It's the same, sir: orders to reinforce troops in the east.","mis_p02_south_042_rebelcamps2_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Are you sure you found everything, Perkins? Nothing encoded?","mis_p02_south_042_rebelcamps2_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Pretty sure, sir. They weren't even bothering to encrypt anything. Rebel command seems to think combat in the west is over.","mis_p02_south_042_rebelcamps2_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I don't buy it.","mis_p02_south_043_rebelcamps3_60reward_0_body_0":"Ramsey is right. There's no way it's already over.","mis_p02_south_043_rebelcamps3_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What have you got, Perkins?","mis_p02_south_043_rebelcamps3_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sir, I'm sorry, but this is very clear. All troops are moving out. Western combat operations are officially over.","mis_p02_south_043_rebelcamps3_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Damn it. What the hell do we do now?","mis_p02_south_043_rebelcamps3_70enddialog_3_body_0":"We're trusting Perkins now? Come on, Morgan, no way they wiped us out. We've got to keep pushing.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, are you sure about this? The Rebel forces are huge.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Cowards will be shot, Specialist Perkins. Don't go soft.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_10startdialog_2_body_0":"That's enough, Sergeant. Perkins, we're Imperial soldiers. This is our responsibility.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_20hint_0_body_0":"To the last man.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_60reward_0_body_0":"All right, folks, let's pack it up.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_0_title_0":"Oh my god, that was brutal!","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Damn it! Let's get back out there!","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It's over, Ramsey. The intel says that between here and the 2nd Corps in the southeast there are hundreds of miles of Rebel patrols even bigger than this one. We won't make it.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Sir, with respect, we don't get to make that call.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_3_body_1":"We are soldiers, and the army is out there. It's our duty to link up with them and retake our country.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_4_body_0":"What do you want me to do, wish the Rebels away? You've seen their forces. There's nothing for us to do out here but die.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Give me a regiment - even just a dozen men - we'll strike where we can. We'll make them pay, and we'll find where the Imperial Army is hiding!","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_5_title_0":"So we retreat? To hell with that - I'll stay behind!","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_6_body_0":"And draw even more attention? If we're ever going to reach the southeast, we're going to need to head home and regroup. We'll need every able body we can get, Ramsey - you especially.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_7_body_0":"You can't be \u2014 sir, permission to speak freely.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_7_title_0":"Dammit, Morgan!","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_8_body_0":"File in, Sergeant. That's an order.","mis_p02_south_050_rebelbattle_70enddialog_8_title_0":"Permission denied.","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_10startdialog_0_body_0":"What's going on?","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_10startdialog_0_title_0":"You're home!?","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_10startdialog_1_body_0":"These men need food and medical attention.","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_10startdialog_1_body_1":"And boots.","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_10startdialog_1_title_0":"Not now, Floyd.","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_20hint_0_body_0":"We can never have enough boots.","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_60reward_0_body_0":"What the hell do we do now?","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_70enddialog_0_body_0":"What's going on? What happened to matching up with the Imperial Army?","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_70enddialog_1_body_0":"There is no Imperial Army. Not in the west anyway. If we want to find them, we'll have to cross more than 1,000 miles of Rebel controlled territory. We're out of our depth.","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_70enddialog_2_body_0":"So what now? We just hole up and hope the Rebels don't come this far north?","mis_p02_south_060_homeagain_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I honestly don't know. The Heartland is crawling with Rebels. We might be able to pick them off one by one, but it's going to be a while before we're ready to head east.","mis_p02_south_rebelcamps_enc_name":"Rebel Camps","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ah, Floyd, I was passing by the Bigfoot Camp, and they seem to be getting a little... antsy.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Interesting! Off the top of my head, one thing that could make so many bigfoots so upset is a massive spiderwasp infestation heading this way. But obviously, that's so unlikely, the chances of it happening are a million to-","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Ramsey! Sound the alarm!  A massive spiderwasp infestation is heading this way!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_10startdialog_3_body_0":"But I just told you, the odds...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Floyd, think about everything that's happened to us so far. If the worst case scenario has almost impossible odds, it's BOUND to happen!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_20hint_0_body_0":"I hear our new lasers work pretty well against spiderwasps.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_60reward_0_body_0":"Welcome to my world.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Your theory flies in the face of probability and statistics, but at least in this case, you were right, Morgan.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_70enddialog_1_body_0":"You can never go wrong overestimating the extent to which fate will screw with you, especially out here.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_010_repelspiderwasp_70enddialog_2_body_0":"That does not comfort me in the slightest.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, Morgan, given recent events, I've been making a concerted effort to be less buried in my research and pay more attention to the outside world...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_10startdialog_1_body_0":"That's great, Floyd, but I'm a little busy...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_10startdialog_2_body_0":"So when the spiderwasps started invading this outpost, I noticed! Right away! I've already started devising countermeasures, and even been fighting some!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I'm happy for you, Floyd, I really am, but considering that I am FIGHTING a bunch of those spiderwasps RIGHT NOW, maybe we could talk about this later?","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Ah! Pardon!  Looks like I need to redouble my efforts to pay attention...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_20hint_0_body_0":"I want so many lasers flying that I get a haircut!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_60reward_0_body_0":"Then it's time for the hoarding and looting!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_70enddialog_0_body_0":"All troops present or accounted for, sir! The outpost is officially clear of spiderwasps!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Phew, that took a while!  Floyd, what's the deal?","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_70enddialog_2_body_0":"If I had to guess, the spiderwasps have probably been going through their native food supply at an accelerated rate, and have followed the bigfoots down here looking for more.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_70enddialog_3_body_0":"First the bigfoots, and now the spiderwasps? What's next, giant cat-dog-mammoths that breathe fire?","mis_p02_spdrwsp_020_outpostspiderwasp_70enddialog_4_body_0":"That's biologically improbable. But one thing I do know: the spiderwasps won't stop, now that they seem to know there's food here.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, folks, we need solutions.  Considering how long it took us to clear out the last spiderwasp invasion, we can't keep just fighting them forever.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I suggest trying what we tried in Sundale: aversion. I've been examining the dead spiderwasps, and I think a special strain of artichoke I've developed will repel them...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Artichokes? Ugh. That's almost worse than the peppers. Hey, couldn't you just use those again?","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_10startdialog_3_body_0":"The peppers were effective against boars, but these are spiderwasps.

That sucked.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_60reward_0_body_0":"Hey, if Floyd doesn't want the Gold, I'll take it!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_0_body_0":"There! Now we just have to wait for results! Although I doubt we'll have any more problems with-","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sir! Sir! My patrol just killed five spiderwasps at the edge of the outpost! They were nibbling on some of the artichokes Floyd planted...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Damn! An hour and a half! Looks like you won the pool, Zoey.","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yippee!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Wait, you BET on how long it would take for my plan to fail?  And you were part of this, Zoey?!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Aw, gosh, now I feel bad. Here, Floyd, you can have some of the Gold if you want...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_030_growturnips_70enddialog_6_body_0":"No, no...  Just leave me to my shame...","mis_p02_spdrwsp_040_trainbigfoots_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Oh, don't feel bad, Floyd. Those artichokes will feed our troops for almost nothing!

Those bigfoots can really fight!","mis_p02_spdrwsp_050_bigfootfights_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I gotta hand it to you, Zoey, they did a good job.

Keep focused.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Not feeling so hot now, are you, Morgan?","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Really, Doug, you lose what, 40 fights in a row, and you come in bragging?","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We both know the scales are even again. You thought you had us solved, and you just realized we're back on your level.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Laugh all you want, pal.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_10startdialog_3_body_0":"If I was on your level, I'd kill myself.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh man! That made him really mad!","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_60reward_0_body_0":"Lasers schmazers. Those guys are screwed.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_70enddialog_0_body_0":"You ain't won nothin'. This war's just gonna keep building up. You see if you like the man it turns you into.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I figure if I get rid of you, I can't do worse than balance the scales.","mis_p02_swlaser_030_fightswlaser3_name":"Bronson and Doug","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Say, Archibald... The Installation didn't happen to give any laser weapons to the Silver Wolves, did they? Say, as a way to get you released?","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What? Heavens, no! Are you telling me those ruffians...?","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Have been firing on us with hot laser-y death?  Yes.","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hmm, this is most disturbing.  You are correct, though; we are the only possible source of laser weapons. If you can get me some from the Silver Wolves, I may be able to determine where and how they did it.","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_10startdialog_4_body_0":"But that would require tracking down and fighting Silver Wolves! \u2026 Hell, I would've done that for free!","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_20hint_0_body_0":"I love being able to mix work and pleasure.","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_60reward_0_body_0":"Someone's been slacking, and it sure hasn't been me!","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Mm hm.  Mm hm.  Mm hmmmmm...","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Are you going to tell us something, or just grunt at us all day?","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_70enddialog_2_body_0":"These are our prototypes, all right.  We never missed them because they were supposed to have been junked for major design flaws.  They're listed in our system as having been destroyed, but here they are, in the hands of the Silver Wolves.","mis_p02_swlaser_040_getweapons_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Wait, they've been fighting us to a standstill with flawed prototypes? Ramsey, double the brutality of our training, starting now!","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So now we know where the Silver Wolves have been getting their lasers, but unless we figure out how, they might be able to get their hands on fully functional models next.","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I have a suggestion, Lieutenant.  Aurora could make a false prototype fitted with a tracking device. We can determine how the Silver Wolves have been getting Installation technology, then stop it at the source!","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Sounds like a plan. We have some technically-minded people around here who can help her out.  Just don't blow up my outpost, and we'll get along famously.","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Pardon me, what?","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_20hint_0_body_0":"Do... things explode regularly around here...?","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_60reward_0_body_0":"Seriously, sir, what is it with you and explosions...?","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Done! And may I say, your Floyd and Zoey are *fascinating* people. Such bright minds! Why, they could-","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yadda yadda egghead.  Do you think this'll fool the Silver Wolves' source?","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It should.  Aurora assures me that it will look, feel, and act just like the real thing. I'll put it into circulation at once.","mis_p02_swlaser_050_makedecoy_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Good. And nothing blew up! I love you Installation guys!","mis_p02_swlaser_060_fightmole_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan! The tracking device says that the false prototype is on the move! Based on my calculations, it's headed directly towards Marin!","mis_p02_swlaser_060_fightmole_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Makes sense; the Silver Wolves wouldn't expect us to look for them there again.  Huh, that's almost clever of them.  Must be Mr. Stephenson's idea.","mis_p02_swlaser_060_fightmole_10startdialog_1_body_1":"Ramsey, let's get moving.  Archibald, Aurora, come with us.  This is probably one of your own, so we might need your help in dealing with them.","mis_p02_swlaser_060_fightmole_20hint_0_body_0":"Can't wait to put all these jokers in their place.","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Look, up ahead...! I don't believe it!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_10startdialog_1_body_0":"What th-? Damn! Of all the rotten luck...!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Chuck! What is the meaning of this? YOU'RE collaborating with the Silver Wolves?","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Yeah, well, at least they're paying me! Wake up! The Empire is gone, and we have nothing left, except what we can take! It's every man for himself now!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You're right! So you'd better hope your pals there are gonna help you once we start kicking your butt all over this town!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_20hint_0_body_0":"This is for all the laser burns I had to treat!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_60reward_0_body_0":"We'd be, like, the ultimate power team!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wh-who the hell are you people...?","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We're the Empire, and don't you forget it!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Splendid work, Lieutenant!  We'll take it from here, if you don't mind. We can determine just what Chuck gave the Silver Wolves. Don't worry; if he doesn't cooperate, we know how to be... unpleasant.","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Wow, that was chilling! If that's what science can do, I'll have to listen to Floyd more often!","mis_p02_swlaser_065_actualfightmole_name":"Chuck","mis_p02_swlg_010_hiddenencounter1_70enddialog_0_title_0":"What the hell was that?","mis_p02_swlg_010_hiddenencounter1_70enddialog_1_body_0":"My boot melted! I can't take it off!","mis_p02_swlg_010_hiddenencounter1_70enddialog_2_body_0":"This boot is the only evidence we have that what happened wasn't just some crazy hallucination brought on by stress and sleep deprivation.","mis_p02_swlg_010_hiddenencounter1_70enddialog_2_title_0":"Hold on, Perkins.","mis_p02_swlg_020_hiddenencounter2_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I think those people attacked us with some kind of portable LASER! This is quite surprising.","mis_p02_swlg_020_hiddenencounter2_70enddialog_0_body_1":"The only laser I know of is Tragan University in Cariston. It was used to teach the more prodigal students the values of lateral thinking. And to scare undergrads.","mis_p02_swlg_020_hiddenencounter2_70enddialog_0_body_2":"I never imagined it was possible to create a weapon out of it! The one I saw weighed a ton and required more power than entire factories. If it can be made portable...!","mis_p02_swlg_030_hiddenencounter3_70enddialog_0_body_0":"If we could get ahold of one of those lasers, why, the applications are endless! We could improve the efficiency of our coal plants, possibly even lower our electricity bill. If my assumptions are correct, that is.","mis_p02_tincans_name":"A Chance to Romance","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, so my bigfoot ideas haven't been goin' so hot. So I figured I'm goin' at this all wrong! What I need to do is teach the bigfoots to defend themselves! That way, they can beat up spiderwasps without us!","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Hmm, you may be on to something there. Giving them their homes and food sources back would certainly be the best solution. What did you have in mind?","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, we have Barracks to train our Troopers, right? Why can't we have one for the bigfoots? I could make it all automated and everything!","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_20hint_0_body_0":"As long as she doesn't teach them explosives use...","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_60reward_0_body_0":"I think Floyd's been spendin' too much time with the LT...","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_70enddialog_0_body_0":"There we go! Looks great, doesn't it?","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Perhaps, but I'll need to inspect this facility for humaneness and safety standards.","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_70enddialog_2_body_0":"What?! Are you sayin' I'm not humane?! Besides, you never inspect any of the Hovels!","mis_p02_trainbg_010_buildcamp_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yes, but those are for Troopers. They signed up for this. These are bigfoots, and *they* deserve to be treated well.","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Uh, Floyd, I still have a problem. I got this great Bigfoot Camp, but no bigfoots. I... actually still don't know how to catch 'em.","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, if you knew, we wouldn't be having problems to begin with. I hear Morgan tried ordering our Peace Keepers to detain some. Apparently, they came back with severe hay fever from all the bigfoot fur.","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We've tried everything, and nothin' seems to work! I just need ONE lousy bigfoot in the Bigfoot Camp to get started! Maybe I can herd them by plantin' a series of high-yield explosives and-","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_10startdialog_3_body_0":"OR we can try something a little simpler. Remember, the bigfoots are here in the first place because they're hungry. Perhaps food could lure them in?","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Hey, that's a great idea!  Shame, though; I'd already planned where I was gonna put the explosives...","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_20hint_0_body_0":"Why do I feel like I just dodged a bullet?","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_60reward_0_body_0":"I'm starting to get a little nervous about this whole scheme...","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Hey, look, it worked! We caught my very first bigfoot! Aw, he's so cute!","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Actually, I think that's a 'she.' Though my bigfoot sexing skills are a tad rusty...","mis_p02_trainbg_020_makefood_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh. Huh. Ah, well, the point is, the Bigfoot Camp can now get up and runnin' with its first student!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, Zoey... How exactly does your Bigfoot Camp train bigfoots?","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, it has a buncha neat automatic gear that uses positive and negative reinforcement to...","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Are you harming the bigfoots?!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_2_title_0":"Wait, negative reinforcement?","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_3_body_0":"When they get ornery, I just give 'em a mean look.","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_3_body_1":"They just up and behave, no problem!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_3_title_0":"Of course not!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_3_title_1":"Like THIS!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Oh, my, that IS a mean look! Why don't we take a look at your training methods in action?","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_20hint_0_body_0":"I didn't know Zoey was capable of that kind of glare!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_60reward_0_body_0":"What did I do...?","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Hmmm... They don't *look* too domesticated and docile...","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Of course not! They wouldn't be able to defend themselves if they were!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You know, Zoey, bigfoots are the perfect cannon fodder: strong, dumb, and plentiful!  As soon as I heard what you were planning, I knew I had to take advantage of the situation! So how about we start giving them rifles and...","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_70enddialog_3_body_0":"LT! Bigfoots don't use weapons! Besides, they don't hafta be \"cannon fodder\"! I'm sure they'd be happy to help out if we just asked them nicely!","mis_p02_trainbg_030_trainbigfoot_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Ask... the bigfoots... nicely...? Floyd, I'm holding you responsible for the corruption of this innocent soul.","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_10startdialog_0_body_0":"See? I told you! I went up and asked the bigfoots nicely if they wanted to help us out, and they said sure!","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"The bigfoots - the smelly, dumb bigfoots - TOLD you that they'd help us out?","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Okay, fine, they didn't SAY anything. But they grunted a lot and looked happy!","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Good enough for me! I know the perfect targets for our new allies: there's a Silver Wolf contingent skulking around nearby, keeping an eye on us. Why don't we introduce them to our new friends?","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, man, I wish I could see the looks on their faces...","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"If any of them make Lieutenant, I'm outta here.","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Wow, did you see that? Bigfoots totally kick butt!","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Toldja so!","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"You know, if Floyd were doing all this, he'd be setting up sanctuaries and personally guarding them with an assault weapon...","mis_p02_trainbg_040_fightwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Aw, the bigfoots just proved they can take care of themselves! Ooh, now that they're Troopers, we can give 'em ranks! We should start Mr. Gray over there as Sergeant Gray, and Miss White as a Private First Class, and...","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You know, LT, if all the bigfoots had been able to defend themselves in the first place, we wouldn't be havin' all this trouble...","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Are you proposing more meddling with the natural order? If so, talk fast, before Floyd comes back.","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I wanna use my bigfoots to teach other bigfoots how to defend themselves too! That way, they can deal with the spiderwasps like they're supposed to, instead of us! All I need is some food to give 'em...","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sure, I guess we can spare some canned potted meat food product...","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_10startdialog_4_body_0":"LT! We can't give that junk to the bigfoots! I'll grow 'em some fresh food at the Farm \u2014 that'll really motivate 'em!","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Oh. I knew that.  Okay, sure, go ahead.","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_20hint_0_body_0":"Food without chemicals never tastes as good.","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_60reward_0_body_0":"Did I hear someone say 'Floyd was right'...?","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So, how did it go? Did the bigfoots take to your lessons?","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That's the weird part... They already knew 'em. Or at least, they were a lot more territorial and aggressive than normal.  And my bigfoots didn't even DO anythin'.","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh.  Well, that's good, right? You accomplished your goal, and you didn't have to do a thing.","mis_p02_trainbg_050_makemace_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well... kinda. But it's gotten me worried.  I did just take peaceful critters and make 'em meaner, and it seems t'be spreadin'. Maybe Floyd was right; maybe this whole \"messin' with nature\" thing wasn't the best idea...","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ah, sir...?  I was wondering...  Do we still care about the uranium?","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Uranium? What does uranium have to do with us?","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_10startdialog_2_body_0":"It's what we were sent here to get in the first place, remember?","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, right.  Between ducking bullets and pacifying seven foot tall Raiders who want to rip my head off, sometimes I forget these details.  So what about the uranium?","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well, I'd been hearing rumors of a mine that makes people sick, like uranium would. I've found a local who can tell us where it is, but it won't be cheap.","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_10startdialog_5_body_0":"Nothing worth having ever is.","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_20hint_0_body_0":"I hear refugees use bars as money on the black market.","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_60reward_0_body_0":"Always happy to help!","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We checked out the information the local gave us.  There is indeed a mine where he said it was.","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_70enddialog_1_body_0":"And?","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_70enddialog_2_body_0":"And... it's very curious. It's there, but it's been abandoned for decades, maybe centuries. It's too new for the Ancients to have dug, but far too old for any other civilization we know of.","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_70enddialog_3_body_0":"But there's no uranium there NOW?  We were conned.","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_70enddialog_4_body_0":"You're focusing on the wrong thing! Sure, there wasn't uranium, but Science has given us an incredible mystery!","mis_p02_uranium_010_turninbars_70enddialog_5_body_0":"\u2026 Thank you, Floyd.","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Floyd, what do you know about uranium?","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Not much; this is top secret material.  It's a rock... and if you stand too close to it for too long, you'll die.  I assume the Empire needed it for some weapon or other, but I only had enough clearance to mine it safely...","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_10startdialog_1_body_1":"I must say, I'm not used to this level of intellectual curiosity from you.  Mind explaining why you wanted to know?","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Certainly.  If I'm going to interrogate that guy who cheated us to find out if he knows more than he's telling, I'll need to know about uranium to tell truth from lies.","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_10startdialog_3_body_0":"And by \"interrogate,\" I assume you mean \"beat him until he sobs like a child.\"","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Of course!","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_20hint_0_body_0":"Cheating me is like cheating the entire Empire!","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_60reward_0_body_0":"After, I think... Wait, were you joking?","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well?  Are you satisfied? Have you indulged your juvenile need for revenge?","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yes and yes, thank you! And I got our bars back!","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I could've used my research to figure out if there was anything of value in the mine, or in the area.  You didn't HAVE to go after that poor man.","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Ah, but I did.  You have to teach people like that a lesson, or they'll walk all over you.  Imperial Assertiveness Training 101.","mis_p02_uranium_020_captureswindler_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Was that before or after Pillaging the Environment for Fun and Profit 203?","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You know, it's strange... That mine is far older than any industrialized civilization.  Were its creators looking for uranium themselves?  If so, for what purpose?","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We're surrounded by homicidal Raiders, heavily armed thugs, and hideous wasp-spider-thingies straight out of nightmares, and THAT'S what you think is strange?","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm serious, Morgan.  This could be key to figuring out why we were sent for uranium to begin with, and how to use it to our advantage in the war!  But I'll need more data.  And for that, I'll need the right tools...","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_20hint_0_body_0":"Scientific exploration requires preparedness!","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_60reward_0_body_0":"If only we had some idea of who did the mining!","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ah, nothing like a successful expedition to get the heart pumping! It really makes you feel alive!","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Successful? So you found answers?","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Absolutely none! All I found were more questions!","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_70enddialog_3_body_0":"So the whole thing was a waste?","mis_p02_uranium_030_buildtools_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Are you kidding?

We did it!","mis_p02_warlord_080_bossbattle_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That we did... Working together... You know, Sheriff, maybe having leaders isn't such a bad thing.

I mean, I knew we, that is, you were going to crush the Silver Wolves, but\u2014","mis_p02_wolfhunt_030_buildsiegestuff_10startdialog_1_body_0":"We didn't. They're using the civilians of New Haven as human shields.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_030_buildsiegestuff_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We'll need to go into Siege mode. Floyd, can we put together some road blocks? Concrete, chains, spikes, whatever we can use to block their movement.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_030_buildsiegestuff_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Zoey and I will get started.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_030_buildsiegestuff_10startdialog_4_body_0":"What about a section of road that's on an axle, and it flips over when you drive on it?

We just catch as many as we can?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_050_fightrunners_10startdialog_2_body_0":"We don't need to get all of them, just enough to keep their supplies low, and wait for them to get hungry enough to negotiate.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_050_fightrunners_20hint_0_body_0":"Negotiate?

The thing is, all the food that gets through? It's going straight to the Silver Wolves.

While our forces may be superior, they have a rather expansive collection of hostages.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_060_makehooch_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Give yourself a little credit Floyd.

What've you got?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_070_resourceturnin_10startdialog_1_body_0":"The soil under New Haven is ideal for tunnelling.

I can oversee excavation and construction, but the real trick is goin' to be waste disposal.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_070_resourceturnin_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Which is where we come in.

I mean, this isn't a permanent structure or anything.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_070_resourceturnin_70enddialog_1_body_0":"I made certain vows, and I'm sorry if it's inconvenient, but they preclude half-assing the design and construction of a tunnel just because we're planning to blow the whole thing up after we're done evacuating.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_070_resourceturnin_70enddialog_1_title_0":"Morgan, I'm a Civil Engineer.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_070_resourceturnin_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Wait, the whole thing is going to be lined with explosive?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_070_resourceturnin_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh, yeah. It was Zoey's idea, but she won us over pretty quickly.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay LT, first thing, we're gonna need some disguises.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_10startdialog_1_body_0":"All right Zoey, this all hinges on you.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_10startdialog_2_body_0":"And us! We'll be there too!","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Right, we're also going to send these children into a combat zone.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_10startdialog_4_title_0":"YAAAAAAAAY!!!","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_20hint_0_body_0":"Disguises are fun!","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_60reward_0_body_0":"As long as you're making spy clothes, why not hide roller skates?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_70enddialog_0_body_0":"These are perfect. The kids'll look exactly like Imperial children!","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Wait, we're just disguising them as Imperials? Why did we have to make special clothes? Don't we have children's clothes? Don't you, like, run an orphanage?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It's not just about sneakin' in. These clothes have a bunch'a secret pockets so we can smuggle in our tools.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_080_makeclothes_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yeah, and the shoes have secret roller skates!","mis_p02_wolfhunt_090_causedisturbance_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Now we just need a disturbance to distract the Silver Wolves while we sneak in.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_090_causedisturbance_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Please, please, please. PLEASE.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_090_causedisturbance_10startdialog_1_title_0":"PLEASE let me do it.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_090_causedisturbance_10startdialog_2_body_0":"All yours Ramsey. Remember, we want them distracted, not on alert. You're supposed to pose a minor threat.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_090_causedisturbance_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I'll keep it as minor as I can.

Did Zoey and the kids get in OK?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_090_causedisturbance_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, they're reassembling their tools, and expect to start on their end of the tunnel within 36 hours.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_100_assistplants_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Our side of the tunnel is coming along well, but Zoey and the kids are going to need supplies inside to get things moving.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_100_assistplants_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm already on it.

We can't go riskin' a big fight like that!

Of course, to do it safely\u2014","mis_p02_wolfhunt_110_distractwolves_10startdialog_1_body_0":"They'll need quite the distraction. I'm sure we can put something like that together.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_110_distractwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"The distraction will be us shooting them.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_110_distractwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"How fake is \"mostly\" fake?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_110_distractwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"We're out! We got a whole buncha people out too. More'n half!","mis_p02_wolfhunt_110_distractwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"That helps, but it's still pretty risky to make a direct attack...","mis_p02_wolfhunt_110_distractwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"We started a mostly fake rumor about gas leaks in northern New Haven.

Are they just really comfortable around maniacs with guns now?","mis_p02_wolfhunt_120_popcap_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Regardless, they need somewhere to stay.

As many as we can manage, at least.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_120_popcap_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Man, this is definitely the weirdest military outpost I've ever been stationed at.","mis_p02_wolfhunt_120_popcap_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It's interesting, isn't it? I mean, we're an outpost for a government that no longer exists. Think of all the twists and turns fate has taken to bring us here. It's pretty unbelievable. It's almost as if\u2014","mis_p02_wolfhunt_120_popcap_70enddialog_3_body_0":"We're the capital now.","mis_p02_zoey_010_buildsomething_10startdialog_0_body_0":"It's not safe for you here.

Please don't blow us up.","mis_p02_zoey_020_buildorphanage_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You know, Floyd, I've been thinking. We've gotten most of the refugees settled in, but some of them are just kids!

I'll be working there myself from time to time.

I think we should take a preemptive strike against them. It's hazardous to our operation to have them wandering around.","mis_p02_zombie_010_stillhere_10startdialog_1_body_0":"And it's demoralizing for our troops.

My days of reckless biological experimentation are over!","mis_p02_zombie_010_stillhere_70enddialog_3_body_0":"I've already stopped listening.

Now.","mis_p03_bossmonster_070_defeattech_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Let me just make a few last minute adjustments.

We're not done.","mis_p03_chili_010_makegroundboar_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Well, I appreciate the thought and all, but from here, it's really about the different cooks bringing their own recipes to the table. No one will tell you what they need for their recipe, or you might be able to figure out the secret.","mis_p03_chili_010_makegroundboar_70enddialog_3_body_0":"That's fine. You tell those other cooks to bring their A game, because the 95th Rifles will be making some chili of our own.

Anyone have a good chili recipe?","mis_p03_chili_020_defeatpepperraptors_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, I have a recipe I've been wanting to try out, but it would require a fairly rare pepper, known to grow only in or near raptor nests.","mis_p03_chili_020_defeatpepperraptors_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Alright, we're gonna call Floyd's plan \"Plan B\". Do we have ANYONE else? Anyone.

We've collected the pepper, which should offer a great depth of flavor to the dish, and, I think you'll find, a subtle bouquet of fruit.","mis_p03_chili_020_defeatpepperraptors_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Sure, but will it be hot?","mis_p03_chili_020_defeatpepperraptors_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I'd recommend protective eyewear in case of splashes.","mis_p03_chili_030_gotocookoff_10startdialog_0_body_0":"OK, everyone except Perkins, let's get moving.

We won!","mis_p03_chili_030_gotocookoff_70enddialog_2_body_0":"The winner is Ray!

I just want to really emphasize how much this means to me, and how much I appreciate the way you, and your town have given us a fresh start!","mis_p03_chili_030_gotocookoff_70enddialog_3_body_1":"That kind of open hearted kindness is Judge Pierce's legacy, and I'm proud to have a part in it!","mis_p03_chili_030_gotocookoff_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Son of a bitch! He was too gracious to even let me vilify him!","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Floyd, I'm not so sure about this. Everyone who comes near the prep kitchen starts crying and runs away. They're saying one guy clawed his eyes out to stop the pain.","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Ugh, exaggerations like that drive me crazy! Yes, he did claw his face a little, but he barely scratched the cornea, and his eyes are certainly not OUT. Anyway, we just need to give it time to mellow. Let the flavors marry.","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_10startdialog_2_body_0":"So, I'm going to go ahead and note in advance that literally everyone knows that if you let spicy food sit overnight it just gets hotter, but screw it. We don't really have any other options.","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_20hint_0_body_0":"Wait\u2026 spicy food gets milder with time, right? Hmm...","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_60reward_0_body_0":"WHYYYYYAYAAAHAAAAHAHHAAAHHHHHGGGGHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u2026","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, the chili is finished.

Thank you Perkins!","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yes, sirs\u2026 hmm, it's actually pretty\u2026 oh\u2026 oh my that is that'sohmythat'sprettyuhhhuhhmmmmohOHOHOHAHAHHAHAHAHHHHHHAAAAAAHHHHHHAHAAAAGGGGGGGAAAAAHHHHAAAAA\u2026","mis_p03_chili_030_simmerchili_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Aw man. Well, add a few cans of stewed tomatoes, some grated cheese, and about a gallon of sour cream.

If I'm right, this is very bad.","mis_p03_conclusions_010_gobacktoi17_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Who is it? Can't you tell me now?","mis_p03_conclusions_010_gobacktoi17_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm not 100% sure, and I'd rather not say anything before I am.","mis_p03_conclusions_010_gobacktoi17_10startdialog_3_body_0":"As a man of Science, I understand the need to be sure before voicing a conclusion.","mis_p03_conclusions_010_gobacktoi17_10startdialog_3_body_1":"I'll pack some Kale juice for the road.","mis_p03_conclusions_010_gobacktoi17_20hint_0_body_0":"Really Floyd, that's not necessary.","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Oh no!  A Rebel ambush!","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You hold them off!  I'll call in back up!","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_20hint_0_body_0":"This only confirms my suspicions.","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_60reward_0_body_0":"But what if we don't?","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Perkins?  PERKINS!","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"They grabbed him, sir!  It's like they used the battle as a smokescreen to get to Perkins.

The ONE TIME I want to hear what he has to say and THIS happens.","mis_p03_conclusions_020_defeatplasmarebels_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Don't worry sir. We'll find him. We'll get him back.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Floyd\u2026what are you doing? Because it looks like you're crushing up pills and putting them in the Lieutenant's coffee.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Your observational skills are acute as ever, because that's exactly what I'm doing.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_1_body_1":"He seems sullen and distant lately. It's just an experimental mood stabilizing drug I've been giving him for a few weeks to see if he'd cheer up.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, you noticed it's been kind of crazy around here with the Rebels and all? I bet he's just focused on work.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_3_body_0":"...It's much worse than I thought.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I got a bit of the blues once, but then I built myself a robot friend. Maybe L.T. just needs someone around to help 'em with cleaning off his desk and polishin' his medallions and stuff.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_10startdialog_5_body_0":"And in the meantime let's\u2026 lay off giving him these\u2026 experimental drugs?","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_20hint_0_body_0":"But drastic measures produce more immediate results!","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_60reward_0_body_0":"\u2026 A reasonable one?","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_70enddialog_0_body_0":"So you can see, one of its arms shoots out cleaning suds and its other arm shoots fire.","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_70enddialog_1_body_0":"\u2026 Why does the helper robot shoot fire?","mis_p03_depressed_010_helperrobot_70enddialog_2_body_0":"What kinda question is that?","mis_p03_depressed_020_killrobot_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Zoey, can you explain to me why there's a killer robot in my house?","mis_p03_depressed_020_killrobot_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Killer robot?

We made it to level 65.","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_0_body_1":"We've survived raiders, silver wolves, rebels, mammoths, ninjas, and creatures who were driven to homicidal rage by poisonous gases.","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_0_body_2":"...Just so you know, I haven't forgiven you for that last one, Floyd.","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Will this commemorative statue that Zoey and I have been working on alleviate your ill will toward me?","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It depends, is it a statue of me?","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_3_body_0":"No. It's a memorial to represent our progress as an Outpost and our commitment to battle head on whatever struggles we may face in the future.","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Then forget it.","mis_p03_levelcap_010_level65_70enddialog_5_body_0":"I think it looks pretty cool! Look at the size of that tank!","mis_p03_marinrebels_010_gotomarin_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Hey Perkins, remember those jerks down in Marin? What happened to those jerks? Are they dead or what?","mis_p03_marinrebels_010_gotomarin_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm not sure, sir. They're always pretty quiet, but recently they've gone totally radio silent. I have some people looking into it, but it's not really at the top of my priority list.","mis_p03_marinrebels_010_gotomarin_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Hmmm\u2026 we probably oughta head down and check it out. There were a lot of civilians there and\u2014","mis_p03_marinrebels_010_gotomarin_10startdialog_2_body_1":"Wait\u2026 why do I care more about their well being than you? When did I become the empathetic one? This is a bunch of crap is what this is.","mis_p03_marinrebels_010_gotomarin_20hint_0_body_0":"A whole bunch of crap.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Oh, there's a bunch of Rebels camped out here. That would explain the whole \"radio silence\" thing. Well, let's go shoot 'em!","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Shouldn't we try to make contact with the Imperials we met previously? Look for some kind of established resistance we can aid?","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Man, I shoulda brought Ramsey. He wouldn't have argued with me when I said to shoot guys. HE would have been cool about it.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Fine, let's shoot them.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_20hint_0_body_0":"Perkins, you give up too easily.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_60reward_0_body_0":"First, I want to talk about how dumb you guys are, which is very dumb.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, Morgan, you might have gotten us all killed, but damn if I don't envy you for what you did.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, I'm pretty great. So, how's the whole \"going along to get along\" thing working out?","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Yeah, I've made some mistakes. I'd appreciate it if you didn't waste time rubbing it in.","mis_p03_marinrebels_020_rebelcamps_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Well, you'll have to appreciate it when I finally stop, because I am about to unload a rubbing in like you've never seen.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Well, after that very, VERY thorough list of reasons I'm a\u2026 what'd you say again? \"Disappointment to my uniform, country and species\"?","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_10startdialog_1_body_0":"And your mother. You're also a disappointment to your mother.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Right. Well, since I can't imagine this being much worse, I'm gonna go ahead and ask you guys a favor. If the Rebel reinforcements show up and we don't have any injuries they're gonna think we helped.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_10startdialog_3_body_0":"So you want us to shoot at you and beat you up so that the Rebels don't?","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Look, you were right about a lot of things, but we can't just abandon the people here, and we can't evacuate in time. This would let us start doing things right.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_20hint_0_body_0":"Man, it's like Festivus!","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_60reward_0_body_0":"Honestly, I can kinda see why.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Man, you guys shot back a lot for guys who were supposed to be taking a beating.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, I mean, you said some pretty messed up stuff. The guys were pretty mad.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Eh, that's fair. You think this'll cover you with the Rebels? We can shoot you some more.","mis_p03_marinrebels_030_beatupdeserters_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Shouldn't be a problem. They've made it clear, we're small potatoes, and as long as it looks like we took shots at you, we'll probably just get medals. They REALLY hate you guys.","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_10startdialog_0_body_0":"It's absolutely unacceptable, Morgan! I will not be a party to the wholesale slaughter of an animal, ESPECIALLY not in an already compromised ecosystem!","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Sorry Floyd, the Spiderwasp nest is too dangerous. We can't risk it. It's a matter of public safety.","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_10startdialog_2_body_0":"As the chief civilian representative on the Outpost, public safety is under MY purview! I will block this at every step!","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_10startdialog_3_body_0":"You're in charge of the sewers and sound construction and \"slow children at play\" sign aspects of public safety. The problems that we solve with machine guns are more my jurisdiction.","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_20hint_0_body_0":"This is unconscionable!","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_60reward_0_body_0":"I suppose that IS why we have Perkins.","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Floyd, this would be a lot smoother if you'd just make a bunch of bug poison or something. You know they're just gonna move again, anyway.","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We don't know that! We know they HAVE in the past. Maybe they'll die! Maybe they'll move to a worse location! Also, poison for something that big is just regular poison. Lacing their nest with it would be quite dangerous.","mis_p03_morewasps_010_gotouraniummine_70enddialog_2_body_0":"So? Isn't that why we have Perkins?","mis_p03_morewasps_020_defeatqueen_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, Floyd, about the Spiderwasp queen...","mis_p03_morewasps_020_defeatqueen_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I'm not going to help you murder her, Morgan. Besides, she won't even come out of her hidden and heavily guarded burrow unless her offspring are endangered\u2026","mis_p03_morewasps_020_defeatqueen_10startdialog_2_body_0":"So we CAN murder her if we just kill her eggs and make her show her face\u2026 maw\u2026 whatever! Just making sure it was possible! It's okay, boys, she's totally murderable!","mis_p03_morewasps_020_defeatqueen_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Wait, Morgan! If you do, one of the other females will simply\u2014! Morgan!","mis_p03_morewasps_020_defeatqueen_20hint_0_body_0":"\"Murderable\" isn't even a word!","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Holy\u2014! She's massive!","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_10startdialog_0_body_1":"This was probably a bad idea\u2026 But I've never let that stop me before! Let's go, men!","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_10startdialog_0_title_0":"That's the Spiderwasp Queen?","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_20hint_0_body_0":"\"Leap before you look\" is my motto.","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_60reward_0_body_0":"It wouldn't hurt to try respecting Science now and again.","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Hey Floyd, remember when were talking about murderability vis a vis the Spiderwasp Queen\u2026 what were you saying at the end there?","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_70enddialog_1_body_0":"While the hives are similar to bee hives in having only one active queen, they parallel wasps in that multiple fertile females will be preemptively fertilized, both for expansion and in case of emergency.","mis_p03_morewasps_025_defeatqueennow_70enddialog_1_body_1":"Depending on the nature of the emergency, the birth rate of males can be modified. Since the previous emergency was food based, we saw mostly drones.

And how long would I have? ...not have?","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Morgan. I'm dealing with it. You stay here. I'll be gone a while.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wait\u2026 are you gonna take care of killing them or of NOT killing them? Because I actually DO want to kill them.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_10startdialog_2_body_1":"That was a ruse.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_20hint_0_body_0":"It was BARELY a ruse.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_60reward_0_body_0":"Besides Zoey.

YOU KNOW IT IS. Why do you do things that hurt people?","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Your lack of memorability is not really of importance. I'm concerned about the work your friend Floyd was engaged in at my Laboratory. The combination of chemicals he collected and synthesized was\u2026 unusual. He hasn't been seen since.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Is he gonna make a bomb?","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_70enddialog_4_body_0":"I do not believe he intends to create an explosive. If he attempted it with the materials in question, I would not expect it to be successful.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_70enddialog_4_body_1":"Then again, maybe he is trying to make an explosive and I am underestimating his level of incompetence.","mis_p03_morewasps_030_makechemicals_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Probably not a big deal then, right? Tell me if you think someone is going to make a bomb.","mis_p03_mystery_010_makebigboard_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Still no leads on the informant\u2026 who could it be?","mis_p03_mystery_010_makebigboard_10startdialog_0_body_1":"OK, let's look at what we know\u2026 organize the information\u2026","mis_p03_mystery_010_makebigboard_20hint_0_body_0":"Make sure to get plenty of string too.","mis_p03_mystery_010_makebigboard_60reward_0_body_0":"Purrface! That string is for the big board!

Did you want me to find some of the people with guns to help?","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_10startdialog_6_body_0":"Oh, yes please!","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_20hint_0_body_0":"Being taken seriously is exhausting.","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_60reward_0_body_0":"Even creeps can be useful.","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Thanks for the hand. What happened there? I thought the Silver Wolves were kind of\u2026 dealt with?","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Evidently not. Any idea where they headed?","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Useful Joe says his cameras caught them heading toward Shigurman's Bluff. Seems like a good place to hide out.","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Useful Joe?","mis_p03_sundance_010_defeatsilverwolves_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Yeah, he's got a bunch of cameras and other tracking equipment set up. We used to call him Creepy Joe, but that's personalityist.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, obviously I love that Silver Wolves are still running around, attacking small towns, and I love that we're still chasing them, but what I love the most is that they were smart enough to wait until this assassination crap threw the Outpost into utter chaos.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Really? Those are all extremely odd things to love. I, for one, am extremely dismayed by each and every one of them.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Wait, seriously? I was\u2026 that was ironical and sardonic. You know, classic Morgan sarcasm? Floyd, you know that, like, 30% of everything I say is a bitter, angry joke, right?","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I would not have estimated it that consistent, no.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_20hint_0_body_0":"Maybe if your jokes were funny instead of just depressing...","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_60reward_0_body_0":"It seems phenomenally inefficient.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_70enddialog_0_body_0":"End of the line folks. Survivors, who wants to talk indentured service under guard while proving your desire to reform?","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Screw you, Morgan. We ain't playin' nice so you can put us to work in a mine. I mean, if you wanna lock us up, fine. Better food and accommodations than most of us are used to anyway. Lead the way to three hots and a cot.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_70enddialog_2_body_0":"No chance of me just letting you go with a promise that you'll stop the stealing and killing and what have you?","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Oh, sure thing. I'm sure we'll make use of the variety of marketable skills we can leverage in this thriving economy.","mis_p03_sundance_020_silverwolvesbluff_70enddialog_4_body_0":"See Floyd, that's sarcasm again. He said a thing that he didn't mean, as a way of making fun of me.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Floyd, what are the odds we can put together some kind of safeguarded prison that isn't just one big human rights violation?","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Zero? I'm going to say zero. The chance of it happening is none. None chance.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Well, way to be a real Negative Nelly about it. OK. Alternatives?","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_3_body_0":"We could kill 'em.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_4_body_0":"It's certainly practical. We can't afford to keep them alive, and we obviously can't let them go. For what it's worth, I'd put the odds of us being able to dig a mass grave at around eighty to eighty five percent likely.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_5_body_0":"In addition to being kinda bummed out by how low those odds are \u2014 I mean, it's a hole, I really think we can pull that off \u2014 I'd like to try something a little less mass murder-y.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_6_body_0":"We could put them in chains and abandon them in the desert. I bet some of them would survive.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_10startdialog_7_body_0":"Well, call the moral relativism world records, that actually feels like the most reasonable solution.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_20hint_0_body_0":"\"It's a hole\" is exactly the thinking that results in failed attempts to dig a mass grave.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_60reward_0_body_0":"So, is working in the mines still an option?","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Silver Wolves, form an orderly line, and we'll get this over with as quickly as we can.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_70enddialog_1_body_0":"What, did you build us houses, then put some fences around us? Are you gonna invite us to the chili cook off?","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Nope. We're chaining you to large balls of iron, and each other. Then we're going to drive you into the middle of the desert wasteland without weapons or supplies. Then we're leaving you.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_70enddialog_3_body_0":"You can't do that! That's\u2014","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Hush now, I haven't done the spooky part. Anyway, between lack of water and food, the brutal weather, and the extremely hostile wildlife, it won't be long before a lot of you are starving to death while chained to the dead body of someone you used to know.","mis_p03_sundance_030_ballandchain_70enddialog_4_body_1":"For those of you who survive, I want you to remember: this experience, what's about to happen to you? This is what I consider humane and generous. I'd keep that in mind the next time you consider coming anywhere near me, or any people under my protection.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins my boy!

I'd love to go kill the giant bears that breathe fire or whatever we have to do to get at those books, but things are REALLY busy right now. The whole thing with the peace talks\u2026","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Certainly. Do you mind if I wait here for you? It wouldn't hurt to get some rest and relaxation before heading back into the field. Perhaps it's time I patch up these old boots.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Sounds great, I'll get some boots for you.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_20hint_0_body_0":"That wasn't really my intention, but I never turn down a gift.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_60reward_0_body_0":"I've kind of got to give him credit.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_70enddialog_0_body_0":"A very thoughtful gift lad, but, as you didn't ask my size, I'm afraid these came out a bit large for me.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Oh, that's just how Imperials make them. One size fits all. You're supposed to adjust them by packing sand into the toe so they don't slide around too much.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Perkins, that simply isn't the case. Imperial boots come in a wide variety of sizes.","mis_p03_sundance_040_makeboots_70enddialog_3_body_0":"But then why did Lieutenant Morgan tell me\u2026 oh, of course.","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins, quickly! I've found myself afoul of a band of Raiders! They claim I've defiled their sacred lands in my tresspasses!","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_10startdialog_1_body_0":"The degree to which this is not the time is just\u2026 it's astonishing.","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_10startdialog_2_body_0":"You! Old man! You cannot avoid us forever!","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_10startdialog_3_body_0":"As the man says Perkins, the timeline is not exactly in my control. Please, help me defend myself from these fanatics!","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_20hint_0_body_0":"Fanatics? What's he talking about?","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_60reward_0_body_0":"One must understand that certain risks and sacrifices are unavoidable.","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well struck, fellows! I'd have been in quite a pickle without your assistance!","mis_p03_sundance_050_percivalyouoldfool_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Well, I'm glad we could help out.

It's good to see you.","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Woah! When did you get here?","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Me? A little while ago. I understand that you've been distracted.","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Man, you ain't kiddin'. What's up? Do you need like\u2026 some ropes? For\u2026 tying things?","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Nothing so specific. Perhaps some hardtack for the road?","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_10startdialog_5_body_0":"I mean, that's\u2026 most of what we make at the bakery. We can probably see to that.","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_20hint_0_body_0":"Every knot was once straight rope.","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_60reward_0_body_0":"Huh, I guess adventurous archeologists have surprisingly dynamic schedules.","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Percival! Sorry, things have been nuts around here. So, what do you say, time to check out the textbooks? If they're for kids, we might even be able to understand them!","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Alas, Perkins dear lad, now is not the time. I must make my way. Other opportunities await. But chin up, I'll return, and perhaps then we can make our attempt.","mis_p03_sundance_060_rations_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just\u2026 I'll see you then.","mis_p03_tankboss_010_wander_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir, remember the time we paid off informants in Recoil Ridge?","mis_p03_tankboss_010_wander_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yes, and I will never let you forget the money we blew on that or the time spent building those persuaders.","mis_p03_tankboss_010_wander_10startdialog_1_body_1":"I know I said I'd punish you, but frankly, I've been kind of busy, and it's just so embarrassing...

Do you know anything about that?","mis_p03_tankboss_010_wander_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I heard nothing you said, Ramsey, because there is still blood on my church pants and I have something important to do in twenty minutes!","mis_p03_tankboss_010_wander_20hint_0_body_0":"Wait, has anyone seen Perkins?","mis_p03_tankboss_015_found_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I am fairly certain there was not a Rebel camp here a few months ago.","mis_p03_tankboss_015_found_20hint_0_body_0":"This is probably not a good idea...","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Yep, Rebels.  Maybe I can sneak past them.","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_20hint_0_body_0":"Aaaand\u2026 they've spotted me.","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_60reward_0_body_0":"The perfectly logical thing to do would be to follow him...right?","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_0_body_0":"...That's it? Where did everyone go?","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We're too late, I'm afraid. It looks like they've already moved the tank.","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_2_body_0":"They? You mean\u2026 you, right? And what tank?","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_3_body_0":"The Rebellion formed from the many nations crushed by the Empire. Without a shared enemy, we aren't so unified these days. There are some of us who would seek to cause as much destruction as possible. I am not one of them.","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_3_body_1":"And\u2026unfortunately, a lot of that destruction seems to be directed at your little outpost.","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_4_body_0":"Us? Why is someone out to get us?","mis_p03_tankboss_020_stragglersattack_70enddialog_5_body_0":"I have a few hypotheses, but I really can't stay and talk.","mis_p03_tankboss_025_seetank_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Wait\u2026 What's casting that imposing shadow?","mis_p03_tankboss_025_seetank_10startdialog_0_body_1":"Salmanca did mention a large tank...","mis_p03_tankboss_025_seetank_20hint_0_body_0":"Why is the ground rumbling?","mis_p03_tankboss_025_seetank_40enc1_dialog1_0_body_0":"AAAAAAGGGHHH! Look at the size of that thing!","mis_p03_tankboss_025_seetank_70enddialog_0_body_0":"I gotta warn everyone at the Outpost!","mis_p03_tankboss_030_heytank_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So Perkins comes back to the Outpost, with big, wide-eyed fear in his eyes, and tells us there's a supermassive, high-tech tank headed this way.","mis_p03_tankboss_030_heytank_10startdialog_0_body_1":"And the smart thing to do is round up all the troops and try to stop it? Because to me that sounds\u2026 idiotic?","mis_p03_tankboss_030_heytank_10startdialog_1_body_0":"If the Rebels are as fixated upon your destruction as their actions make them appear to be, then the logical assumption is that they'll be taking the tank here next.","mis_p03_tankboss_030_heytank_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm sorry, were you invited to this conversation? We're talking military things. If I want someone to research like... soil pH levels... I'll call you.","mis_p03_tankboss_030_heytank_10startdialog_3_body_0":"...

We need to get rid of this tank before it gets rid of us.","mis_p03_tankboss_030_heytank_20hint_0_body_0":"Actually, I'd prefer you had ME check soil pH levels. It's kind of my specialty\u2026","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I just can't believe after all that money and effort wasted trying to find out what the Rebels were planning, we figure out they're building a giant super tank because Perkins took a stroll.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_10startdialog_1_body_0":"I mean, I used to read books on how to treat ladies and stuff and never had any luck. But me and Cassidy. Well, we just kind of happened.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_10startdialog_2_body_0":"So you're saying if I treat the Rebels like I treat my dating life, then all the intel will just stumble into our laps and we'll live happily ever after?","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_10startdialog_2_body_1":"Wait. No. Never mind. That analogy makes no sense when applied to me.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I mean, there was that thing with Yenchka\u2014","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Shut up, Perkins!","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_20hint_0_body_0":"At least SOMEONE loves me!","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_60reward_0_body_0":"I mean, have you ever fought a GIANT ANCIENT ROBOT?","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_0_body_0":"The path is clear to the Rebel tank.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, though I thank you for your assistance, you should not have come. My men and I can handle it from here.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_2_body_0":"No offense, General, but we didn't come here to assist you.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_2_body_1":"And it didn't really look like you were handling anything until we showed up.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_3_body_0":"You have a point, Lieutenant. Though I would warn you this vehicle is more dangerous than anything you've ever faced.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_4_body_0":"I really, seriously doubt that.","mis_p03_tankboss_040_defeatsupertankdefenders_70enddialog_4_title_0":"I doubt that.","mis_p03_tankboss_050_defeatsupertank_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Perkins, give me the binoculars.","mis_p03_tankboss_050_defeatsupertank_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Yes, sir, but you're not going to like what you see\u2026","mis_p03_tankboss_050_defeatsupertank_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Yep.

Go in and blow it up? I mean\u2026 I guess I don't understand why you'd ask that?

His perfect teeth!","mis_p03_tankboss_050_defeatsupertank_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Oh look, it's that rebel General guy with the perfect teeth, riding in on his white horse after we cleaned up his mess.","mis_p03_tankboss_050_defeatsupertank_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Lieutenant Morgan, though circumstances have made us enemies, I cannot thank you enough for the service that you have provided for the people of the frontier.","mis_p03_tankboss_050_defeatsupertank_70enddialog_1_body_1":"These citizens may rest safe, knowing that such a hero like you has rescued them from certain destruction.

That's all?","mis_p03_temp_030_makeweapons_10startdialog_3_body_0":"That's all.

It happens a lot around here.","mis_p03_temp_040_gototrotbeck_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, Ma, I've been, let's face it, a pretty incredible sport about this, but there is NO WAY your normal assistant gets shot, maimed, or set on fire as often helping you as I have been.

I'm just all\u2026 I'm overwhelmed, but I'm also distracted and\u2026","mis_p03_yenchka_020_gotoraidersanctuary_10startdialog_0_body_1":"It's hard, because I want to talk about it, get some advice, but, let's be honest, all of you are insane. Though Elder Taos, aside from all that terrifying cultural stuff, could actually be the most rational person around. I guess I could try talking to him.","mis_p03_yenchka_020_gotoraidersanctuary_10startdialog_0_body_2":"You know, sometimes I really find myself wishing Judge Pierce was still alive.","mis_p03_yenchka_020_gotoraidersanctuary_10startdialog_0_body_3":"Thanks, Perkins.","mis_p03_yenchka_020_gotoraidersanctuary_20hint_0_body_0":"He's right, he IS easy to talk to.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Ahh, the Skinny Beast. What calamity have the winds brought to your door now?","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Oh, nothing. Well, you know, Rebels, mysterious powerful people or groups conspiring against us in the shadows and giant bugs and stuff. But nothing new. I'm kind of in a funk, honestly. Not sure why.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Indeed? Rare is the man who can see himself, rarer still the man who knows for what he searches.  You will not find her here. Yenkcha has rededicated herself to her Dustwalker training in order to measure up to the Skinny Beast.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"So, first, I still don't remember her, and that's NOT why I came here, but if I DID care, where would I look?","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Directions to the training grounds cannot be given, they must be earned.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_20hint_0_body_0":"Is there anything Raiders don't resolve with violence?","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_60reward_0_body_0":"That explains all the very obvious training equipment there.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well fought, Skinny Beast. You will find the Dustwalker training grounds in the fields around Blades in Moonlight's camp.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Huh. Yeah, that's pretty obvious in retrospect.","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_70enddialog_2_body_0":"It's kind of a \"hide in plain sight\" thing, you know?","mis_p03_yenchka_030_defeatdustwalkers_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.","mis_p03_yenchka_040_gotoblades_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I mean, if you hadn't said you'd tell me, I think Crazy Blade's Base is probably the very first place I would have checked, honestly.","mis_p03_yenchka_040_gotoblades_10startdialog_1_body_0":"True, but you do not think like one of my people. Only an outsider would ever venture to the home of Blades in Moonlight without good reason.","mis_p03_yenchka_040_gotoblades_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I'm not saying I'm thrilled to go there, but still, it just doesn't seem reasonable to say the location \"is secret\" when you really mean \"is in a really scary place\".","mis_p03_yenchka_040_gotoblades_20hint_0_body_0":"It's just disingenuous.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_10startdialog_0_body_0":"You have arrived late.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Well, I didn't actually tell you I was coming. I mean, when someone barges into your home there's no \"late\" or \"on time\". It just happens when it happens.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Take one rock from the mountain. Take two. Take two thousand. When do you take the mountain?","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Hey, cool, so\u2026 is Yenkcha around or whatever? Cause I guess I kind of feel like knowing what she looks like?","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_10startdialog_4_body_0":"You see so little, Scrawny Beast.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_20hint_0_body_0":"Hey, it's Skinny Beast, which is less upsetting!","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_60reward_0_body_0":"Also, rivers totally swell by standing still. That's how dams work.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_70enddialog_0_body_0":"No heart propels your blade. You travel in a blizzard. You walk in circles and call it progress.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Yeah, I use a gun? The blades are your thing. Aside from being crazy, they're like, your WHOLE thing. Besides, I was asking about Yenkcha, not for inappropriately familiar personal assessments.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_70enddialog_2_body_0":"The river does not swell by standing still. There is power in motion. She will envelop you.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_70enddialog_3_body_0":"So\u2026 she's gone? And she's\u2026 moving to gain power\u2026 and she still likes me? If that's correct, say something terrifying.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_70enddialog_4_body_0":"His crop is man. Mountains shed their cloaks to hills, and still he plans. You call him friend. He would not call you pet.","mis_p03_yenchka_050_defeatcrazyblades_70enddialog_5_body_0":"Cool! I'm taking that as a yes.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_10startdialog_0_body_0":"I've got some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that those horrible zombie monstrosities of yours are running amok in the Outpost. Again.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Hey Floyd!","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_10startdialog_1_body_0":"They're not \"zombies\". They're simply the unfortunate side effect of trying to make nanopods go a bit further. In hindsight, creating the Black Nanopods and attempting to heal Imperial troops with them was a bit\u2026 misguided.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_10startdialog_1_body_1":"You said there was good news?","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Good news for me, at least. I'm assigning you and Zoey to take care of the problem. That way I don't have to deal with these rampaging horrors. Try to keep the morally questionable experimentation to a minimum, OK?","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_10startdialog_3_body_0":"I'll start settin' up the traps!","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_20hint_0_body_0":"\"Zombies\". There's no such thing. It's silly.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_60reward_0_body_0":"Are you guys done yet? I wanna use my hot tub.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Well, we managed to take out quite a few of 'em. Still a bunch wanderin' around though.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Such is the nature of things, Zoey. I doubt we'll ever be able to get rid of every single one of them but at least we've thinned the herd, so to speak.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_70enddialog_1_body_1":"We'll have to keep watch for more around the Outpost for the time being. This will also give us a chance to collect more of those Black Nanopods\u2026 for research purposes.","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I thought the LT said to not do any evil experiments?","mis_p03_zombie_010_morezombies_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Science is never evil if used properly!","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_10startdialog_0_body_0":"So, uh, Floyd? Have you used any of those Black Nanopods yet? Some of those injured soldiers in the Hospital are probably going to die anyway.","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_10startdialog_0_body_1":"Just sayin'.","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_10startdialog_1_body_0":"You mean, have I used any of our wounded troopers as guinea pigs to infect with these horribly misappropriated nanopods in order to create our very own army of\u2026 ahem\u2026 zombies?","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Right. That's pretty much the EXACT thing I just asked you.","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_10startdialog_3_body_0":"No Morgan, not yet. Remember, there's no cure for the infection and we would need a special facility\u2014","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Well get the lead out! Build us a special Infection Test Facility and get this horror show on the road! Man, it's like pulling teeth with you.","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_20hint_0_body_0":"As an ethical man, I'm against this, but as a Scientist...","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_60reward_0_body_0":"I'll try not to harm the mindless killing machine, sir.","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Alright Morgan, your abomination is ready.","mis_p03_zombie_020_morezombies_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Abomination? This is a thing of beauty!

Don't hurt it.","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_10startdialog_0_title_0":"Success! HAhaha!","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Floyd? What are you maniacally cackling about? Have you created another highly contagious strain of \"The Mondays\"?","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_10startdialog_2_body_0":"No Morgan! Far more exciting, I've been able to establish communications with our infected former fellow soldiers. What we thought were mindless killing machines are still thinking, feeling beings!","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Oh, that's pretty neat, I guess. What are they saying?","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Oh, uh, well\u2026 it seems that they are quite angry and, oh no. They want to kill all of us. They're challenging us to a massive battle.","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_10startdialog_5_body_0":"This kind of thing seems to happen every year, so, this year I invited a \"consultant\" to the Outpost. She seems friendly, unless you're a zombie.","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_20hint_0_body_0":"I hope she knows this is a seasonal position.","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_60reward_0_body_0":"She's beautiful...","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_70enddialog_0_body_0":"OK, so, she's scary and deadly.","mis_p03_zombie_030_zombieslayer_70enddialog_0_body_1":"Ramsey?

How'd this weirdo get past our perimeter?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_010_dostuff_10startdialog_2_body_0":"I am not weirdo! I am Misha, Heavy weapons guy! I here because\u2014","mis_tf2_heavyscout_010_dostuff_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Yeah, I don't have time to care. You don't look like a Rebel, but if you don't want us to toss you into a cell, you'll have to prove to us that you won't kill us all.","mis_tf2_heavyscout_010_dostuff_10startdialog_3_body_1":"Rustle up some chow, take care of those Rebels attacking us, shore up our defenses\u2026 Whatever. Perkins, watch him while he does that.","mis_tf2_heavyscout_010_dostuff_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Er\u2026 What am I supposed to do against HIM if he does try to kill us all\u2026?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_010_dostuff_10startdialog_5_body_0":"I said I don't have time to care, didn't I?

Do you want ours?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Man, that Heavy weapons guy sure did a number on those Rebels! Ramsey, I think I might have another friend in the \"big violent guy with a huge gun\" category!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Look, Mister\u2026 uh, Heavy, we're the Imperial Army.

I kill more of your Rebels than anyone!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Anyone\u2026? Sorry to disagree, but *I'm* the top Rebel shooter around here.","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_10startdialog_4_body_0":"Then we have contest! We go shoot Rebels! Highest body count wins! Is good, yes?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_20hint_0_body_0":"Oh, yeah, is good! I love a good shooting competition!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_60reward_0_body_0":"It's been a long time since I've met someone with my kind of interests!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Whew! That was a pretty good workout! How many Rebels did you take down, Heavy?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_70enddialog_1_body_0":"So many, I lose count! Piles and PILES of them! Hahahahaha!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_020_killingcontest_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Same here! Hah, you really aren't such a bad guy! Hell, welcome to the Outpost!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_030_trainscouts_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Morgan, I think we should find the Scout that my buddy here is looking for.

So where is he?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_030_trainscouts_10startdialog_2_body_0":"If I knew, I not look here! I find him already!","mis_tf2_heavyscout_030_trainscouts_10startdialog_3_body_0":"You know, maybe it takes a Scout to find a Scout.

They look a little\u2026 weird without the gas masks, but they seem to have the skills we need.","mis_tf2_heavyscout_030_trainscouts_70enddialog_1_body_0":"Fan them out across the area. Have them report anyone who looks or is acting strange.","mis_tf2_heavyscout_030_trainscouts_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Hey, LT, I finished that new automated milkshake machine I was tellin' ya about! Only it's still a little, uh, homicidal, so don't turn it on just yet, okay?","mis_tf2_heavyscout_030_trainscouts_70enddialog_3_body_0":"\u2026 I mean besides us.","mis_tf2_heavyscout_040_rescuescout_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Sir!

What mission? What were you doing sneaking around to begin with?","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Okay, you people have exactly five seconds to tell me what's going on before I start volunteering you both for Floyd's genetic experiments.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_10startdialog_1_body_0":"See, we're on a real vital mission! We're fightin' a company called RED. My team an' I have been all over this place, trying to find their base so we can take the important item they got!

We must tell comrades at once!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Great, there are more of you? No, no, really, I'm thrilled.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_10startdialog_4_body_0":"I'd call 'em, only my radio kinda got clawed up by those raptors, and none of yours got the frequency codes I need.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_10startdialog_5_body_0":"No problem! We got a Tool Shop here you can use to make yer own!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_10startdialog_6_body_0":"Cool! But, uh\u2026 Looks like some o' those raptors followed us back here. Guess I must smell good, huh? Heh...","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_20hint_0_body_0":"This is technically insubordination, but keeping Zoey busy makes her happy.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_60reward_0_body_0":"Perkins, front and center! I gotta exert some unnecessary authority!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Got 'em!

Join us?","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_70enddialog_2_body_0":"I just gotta grab my gun. Let's do this!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_010_radioraptors_70enddialog_3_body_0":"Why are people making decisions without consulting me?

We got no idea what to expect.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_020_fightrebels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Of course not. Floyd, Zoey, hold down the fort while we're gone.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_020_fightrebels_10startdialog_2_body_1":"Zoey, if Floyd tries to insurrect, hit him with a wrench.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_020_fightrebels_20hint_0_body_0":"That's why I always wear the hard hat.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_10startdialog_0_body_0":"Mikhail, finally! Where the hell have you been?! In case you haven't noticed, we're in the middle of a MISSION here!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_10startdialog_1_body_0":"Making friends! Here they are!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_10startdialog_2_body_0":"Friends? Friends?!? This is WAR!

Welcome aboard, private! Your mission is to help us ANNIHILATE these mewling RED pansies guarding their base!","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_20hint_0_body_0":"\u2026 Private?!?","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_60reward_0_body_0":"It's served me well so far.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_70enddialog_0_body_0":"Ach, who were those howlin' scunners with the RED tossers? I ha'nt seen the likes of them before.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_70enddialog_1_body_0":"We have. Guess the Rebels teamed up with RED.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_025_fightrebels_70enddialog_2_body_0":"Y'know, it's oddly comforting to always expect the worst. You're never unpleasantly surprised.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_030_trainsoldiers_10startdialog_0_body_0":"If the Rebels and RED are fighting together, we're going to need some kind of edge.

I can't think of anything right now so maybe a nap? Yeah, that sounds good.","mis_tf2_solpyrodemo_030_trainsoldiers_10startdialog_3_body_0":"Now you're making sense!
